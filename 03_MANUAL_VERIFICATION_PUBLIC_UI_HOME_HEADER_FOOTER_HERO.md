# My Gujarat Property — Prompt 03 Manual Verification: Public UI, Home, Header, Footer And Hero Search

This prompt is for Claude Code.

Use this prompt immediately after completing:

```txt id="matching-implementation-prompt"
prompts/03_PUBLIC_UI_HOME_HEADER_FOOTER_HERO.md
```

This prompt verifies the **Public UI, Homepage, Header, Footer, City Selector, Hero Search Section and Public Navigation Foundation** phase.

Do not skip this verification.

Do not start Prompt 04 until this verification is complete or the project owner/Super Admin explicitly accepts a documented `PARTIAL`, `BLOCKED` or `SETUP_REQUIRED` state.

Do not mark PASS without real UI/responsive/security checks.

Do not fake PASS.

```txt id="admin-link-search"
Admin
Staff
Super Admin
/admin
/admin/login
Provider Settings
Internal
Audit Logs
System Settings
```

It is okay for admin route to exist internally.

It is not okay for public header/footer/homepage to link it.

If public admin link is visible:

* remove/fix if safe

---

## 17. Dead Link Verification

Search for:

```txt id="dead-link-patterns"

* footer legal links
* footer contact
* mobile menu links

Rules:

Search for hardcoded:

* phone numbers
* personal emails
* WhatsApp numbers
* private addresses
* hidden contact fields

Official support contact may be allowed only if business approved and public, but must not be private user contact.

If hidden/private contact leaks:

## 47. Verification Result Decision

Use these rules.

### PASS

Mark `PASS` only if:

* homepage loads
* build passes
* existing header preserved or safely fixed
* city selector preserved or safely fixed
* hero search appears below header
* search routes to `/search`
* no dead key links
* no `href="#"` in touched UI
* no public admin link
* no fake public data
* no hidden contact leak
* guest header correct
* logged-in header behavior verified or setup-required documented
* footer public-safe and responsive
* dashboard/admin footer separation checked where applicable
* responsive widths checked
* docs updated
* no blocking bugs

### PARTIAL

Use `PARTIAL` if:

* UI works but not all responsive widths tested
* logged-in states cannot be runtime-tested due to auth setup-required
* search route is placeholder only
* some footer legal routes are placeholders
* minor non-blocking UI issues exist
* tests not configured but build passes
* cross-browser testing not done

Prompt 04 can start only if user/Super Admin accepts partial and no critical public/security issue exists.

### FAIL

Use `FAIL` if:

* homepage broken
* build fails
* existing header/city selector removed
* hero search missing/dead
* `/search` linked but missing
* public admin link visible
* hidden contact leaks
* fake data displayed as real
* major mobile horizontal scroll
* dead primary CTA
* provider secret exposed
* auth trigger fakes login/success

Do not start Prompt 04.

### BLOCKED

Use `BLOCKED` if:

* Prompt 02 auth foundation failed and UI depends on it
* cannot inspect required files
* project cannot run/build due to unresolved baseline issue
* existing UI architecture conflict needs owner decision
* required Prompt 03 files missing

### SETUP_REQUIRED

Use `SETUP_REQUIRED` for:

* auth provider missing for runtime logged-in tests
* location backend missing
* legal/CMS routes missing
* search backend missing
* notification provider missing if bell hidden/setup state

Setup-required is acceptable only if UI does not fake functionality.

* Prompt 03 implementation completed
* Prompt 03 verification completed
* no critical public UI bug open
* no public admin link

* no fake public data
* homepage/search route safe
* docs updated
* `brain.md` updated
* next prompt file exists:

  * `prompts/04_PROPERTY_PROJECT_REQUIREMENT_SYSTEM.md`

## 51. If Verification Fails

If verification fails:

1. do not start Prompt 04
2. create/update bug entries
3. update `MANUAL_VERIFICATION.md`
4. update `SECURITY_RLS_CHECKLIST.md`
5. update `PERFORMANCE_CHECKLIST.md`
6. update `DEPLOYMENT_ROLLBACK.md`
7. update `brain.md`
8. state exact blocker
9. fix if safe and in scope
10. rerun verification
11. only then proceed

Critical failures block progress.

## 52. If Verification Is Partial

If verification is partial:

* document what is partial
* list untested widths/states
* list setup-required dependencies
* confirm no critical public/security bug exists
* update docs
* ask/require owner acceptance before Prompt 04 if risk is significant

Acceptable partial examples:

* search route placeholder only
* logged-in role header not runtime-tested because auth setup-required
* some legal footer pages are placeholders
* cross-browser not tested
* full SEO not implemented yet

Not acceptable partial without fix:

* public admin link
* hidden contact leak
* existing header removed
* city selector removed
* homepage broken
* fake data shown as real
* search CTA dead
* build fail

* update `FEATURE_REGISTRY.md`
* update `CHANGELOG.md`
* update `SECURITY_RLS_CHECKLIST.md`
* update `PERFORMANCE_CHECKLIST.md`
* update `brain.md`
* final response should say Prompt 04 can start

Do not start Prompt 04 automatically unless user asked to continue.

This verification is successful when future phases can trust:

* homepage is stable
* existing header/city selector preserved
* hero search is placed correctly
* public navigation is safe
