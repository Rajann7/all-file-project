## 2. Core Advanced Feature Principles

Advanced features must follow these principles:

1. Core marketplace features come first.
2. Advanced features must not break core flows.
3. Advanced features must be feature-flagged if risky.
4. Advanced features must be real or setup-required.
5. No fake analytics.
6. No fake alerts.
7. No fake notifications.
8. No fake PWA support.
9. No fake offline support.
10. No fake price history.
11. No fake matching score.
12. No fake construction progress.
13. No fake inventory.
14. No fake RERA/verified status.
15. No hidden contact leak.
16. No private data in analytics.
17. Provider-backed features must have honest provider status.
18. Manual verification required before PASS.
19. AI/API recommendation features are not in current scope unless explicitly approved later.
20. Future features must be documented as future/deferred, not silently implemented fake.

---

## 3. Advanced Feature Status Values

Use these statuses:

| Status                     | Meaning                           |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- |

| `IN_PROGRESS`              | implementation started            |
| `PARTIAL`                  | partially implemented             |
| `PASS`                     | fully implemented and verified    |
| `FAIL`                     | implemented/tested but failing    |
| `BLOCKED`                  | blocked by dependency             |
| `SETUP_REQUIRED`           | provider/config missing           |
| `DEFERRED`                 | intentionally planned for later   |
