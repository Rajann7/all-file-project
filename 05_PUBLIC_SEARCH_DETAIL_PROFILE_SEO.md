* no keyword stuffing
* no fake claims
* no hidden contact

* point to stable slug URL
* avoid duplicate query variants for detail pages
* search pages can canonical to normalized query or base search depending SEO strategy
* no canonical to private/dashboard/admin pages
* no raw local/dev URL in production

* useful public search/location pages if real data exists
* CMS/legal/blog later when implemented

Do not index fake/thin pages.

---

## 30. Structured Data / Schema Rules

Schema may be added carefully.

Allowed:

* fake price if not real
* unapproved data

If unsure, use minimal BreadcrumbList only.

---

## 31. Breadcrumb Requirements

Detail/profile pages should include breadcrumbs:

Property example:

```txt id="property-breadcrumb"
Home > Search > Property > 2 BHK Flat in Rajkot
```

Project example:

```txt id="project-breadcrumb"
Home > Search > Projects > Project Name
```

Broker example:

```txt id="broker-breadcrumb"
Home > Brokers > Broker Name
```

Builder example:

```txt id="builder-breadcrumb"
Home > Builders > Builder Name
```

Breadcrumbs must not include hidden contact/private address.

---

## 32. Sitemap Foundation

If implementing sitemap:

* include only public-safe published pages
* exclude draft/pending/rejected/paused/deleted/private
* exclude admin/dashboard/auth private pages
* exclude placeholder/thin/noindex pages
* include canonical detail URLs
* include public profile URLs if useful and published
* no fake URLs
* handle pagination/splitting later if large

If sitemap is not implemented yet, document `PARTIAL`.

---

## 33. Robots Foundation

If implementing robots:

* disallow private/admin/dashboard where appropriate
* allow public pages
* reference sitemap if sitemap exists
* do not expose private routes through robots as security mechanism only
* route protection still required

Robots is SEO guidance, not access control.

---

## 34. Slug Handling Requirements

Slug pages must:

* fetch by slug
* only show published safe entity
* handle not found
* handle deleted/expired
* avoid leaking whether private draft exists where sensitive
* avoid duplicate slugs
* support future redirect if slug changes
* avoid phone/email/private address in slug

If slug missing, redirect or 404 safely.

---

## 35. Search Query Security

Search implementation must:

* validate query params
* limit page size
* safely map sort fields
* avoid raw SQL injection
* avoid unbounded wildcard scans where possible
* use indexes
* avoid exposing private table rows
* use public-safe views/projections
* avoid server errors for invalid params

---

## 36. Public Search Data Source

Preferred:

* public-safe views
* server-side query with explicit safe select fields

Avoid:

* selecting `*` from private entity tables
* filtering private table client-side
* returning private fields to browser
* relying on frontend to hide contact
* exposing draft/pending rows

If public-safe views do not exist, create or update them with migration.

---

## 37. Filters To Implement

Implement practical filters based on schema availability:

* entity type
* purpose
* category
* property/project type
* city
* locality/area if available
* price/rent range
* area range
* BHK where applicable
* posted by
* RERA registered for projects if safe
* possession status if safe

Do not implement filter that cannot query real data.

Do not show fake filter counts.

---

## 38. Search Card Actions

Card actions:

* view details
* save
* contact/inquiry
* share

Rules:

* view details routes to slug page
* save requires auth/setup later
* contact/inquiry requires auth/setup later
* share uses public URL
* no fake save state
* no fake inquiry
* no phone/email reveal

Detail CTAs:

* Contact / Request Contact
* Send Inquiry
* Save
* Share
* Report
* View Uploader Profile

Rules:

* contact/inquiry triggers auth/setup-required
* save triggers auth/setup-required

* share copies/shares public URL
* uploader profile link public-safe
* no fake lead created
* no fake report submitted

---

## 40. Detail Page Mobile UX

Detail pages must be mobile-first.

Required:

* gallery scroll safe
* readable price/title
* sections collapsed/organized
* no horizontal scroll
* buttons large
* contact CTA not covering content
* share/report accessible

---

## 41. Gallery Placeholder UX

If media unavailable:

* show neutral placeholder
* do not show fake property/project photo
* do not show fake “10 photos”
* do not show broken image
* do not stretch image area badly
* use safe alt text

If public media exists:

* show real media only
* lazy-load
* public URL only
* no private signed URL exposed unless intended public-safe

---

## 42. Public Profile Listing Sections

Broker profile listing section:

* only approved/published properties from that broker
* no fake property count
* no hidden contact
* no draft/pending/rejected items

Builder profile project section:

---

## 43. Empty / Unavailable Detail States

If entity not found/private/deleted:

Show safe state:

```txt id="unavailable-state-copy"
This listing is not available right now.
```

Do not reveal:

* “This draft exists”
* “Rejected by admin”
* owner private info
* moderation reason
* hidden contact
* internal status

Use 404/noindex where appropriate.

---

## 44. Legal/Safety Disclaimer

Detail pages should show marketplace disclaimer:

```txt id="detail-disclaimer"
My Gujarat Property is a marketplace. Please independently verify ownership, documents, RERA details, pricing and legal information before making any transaction.
```

Project detail should include RERA disclaimer where applicable.

Do not claim legal guarantee.

---

## 45. Report Listing Placeholder

Report CTA foundation may include:

* opens auth for guest
* shows setup-required/coming later
* no fake report success
* no hidden contact
* full report system later Prompt 08/13

If report form implemented, validate and store safely.

---

Rules:

* no fake claim approval
* no public private docs
* requires auth later

* unavailable/deleted/expired
* setup-required only

Do not create mass SEO pages with no real data.

---

## 48. Future Location SEO Page Boundary

This phase can prepare search query SEO.

Full city/locality SEO pages come in Prompt 11.

Do not generate thousands of location pages now.

Allowed:

* `/search?city=rajkot`
* title/meta generated from query
* noindex if empty/thin

Deferred:

* `/gujarat/rajkot/flats-for-sale`
* locality landing pages
* district/taluka pages
* sitemap split for location pages

---

## 49. Multi-Language Boundary

This phase may keep English-only.

Do not fake Gujarati/Hindi pages.

If localization foundation exists:

* support labels safely
* no legal translation fake
* no hreflang unless pages exist

Full localization is later advanced/docs phase.

---

## 50. Performance Requirements

Search/detail/profile pages must:

* use indexes
* avoid unbounded queries
* avoid loading all listings
* avoid N+1 profile queries
* lazy-load images
* avoid heavy map scripts
* avoid payment scripts
* avoid analytics SDK unless configured
* use server components where suitable
* cache public-safe pages carefully
* not cache private data

Private/dashboard pages must not be publicly cached.

---

## 51. Caching Requirements

Allowed caching:

* published public-safe detail pages
* public-safe search results with revalidation
* public profile pages with revalidation
* static SEO helpers

Do not cache:

* private profiles

* signed URLs/private media

If unsure, use no-store for sensitive pages.

---

## 52. RLS / Security Requirements

Verify and maintain:

* public pages use public-safe views
* private tables protected
* public cannot read private rows
* wrong user cannot access draft through detail slug
* contact hidden
* profile private fields hidden
* admin/staff private fields hidden
* no direct URL bypass for private preview
* no service role client usage

If new views are needed, add migration and RLS/security docs.

---

## 53. SQL Migration Rule

This phase may require DB migration for:

* public-safe views
* search indexes
* slug indexes
* profile public views
* sitemap helper views
* SEO status fields if missing

If DB changes are made, create migration:

```txt id="migration-name"

```

Migration must include:

* purpose
* phase: Prompt 05
* views/tables/indexes changed
* RLS changes
* destructive changes yes/no
* backup required yes/no
* rollback notes

No DB change without migration.
