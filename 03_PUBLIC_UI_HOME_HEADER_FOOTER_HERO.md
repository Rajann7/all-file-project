## 4. Current Code Inspection Required

Before changing code, inspect:

```txt id="inspect-required"
src/app/page.*
app/page.*
src/app/layout.*
app/layout.*
src/app/search/
app/search/

```

Search for existing:

* homepage
* header
* guest header
* owner header
* city selector
* hero section
* search box
* footer
* auth popup trigger
* login/register buttons

---

## 5. Critical Preservation Rule

The user has specified:

* existing guest homepage header is ready
* existing owner homepage header is ready
* existing city selector is ready
* preserve existing design
* old homepage hero copy should only be used for the Hero Search Section
* place Hero Search Section below existing header
* do not replace existing header/city selector
* search should route to `/search`
* do not add AI/API/maps/WhatsApp/OTP/payment/Cloudflare now unless already implemented by previous phases

Claude must follow this exactly.

If existing header/city selector exists and works:

* preserve it
* only minimally adjust for role-aware behavior if needed
* do not redesign it
* do not rewrite it from scratch
* do not remove existing responsive behavior
* do not remove existing city selector
* do not break brand layout

If existing header is broken:

* fix it carefully
* preserve visual style as much as possible
* document exact fix

```

If route missing:

* create safe placeholder if in scope
* or remove/hide link
* or show disabled reason

Do not use `href="#"`.

---

## 38. Footer Route Safety

Footer links must be safe.

Possible future routes:

```txt id="footer-routes"
/about
/contact
/support
/help
/faq
/blog
/legal/privacy
/legal/terms
/legal/refund-policy
/legal/listing-policy
/legal/advertising-policy
/legal/verification-policy
/legal/disclaimer
/pricing
/search
```

If routes are not implemented:

* avoid link
* or create basic placeholder legal/support pages only if safe
* or point to existing route
* do not leave broken/dead links

Full CMS/legal comes in Prompt 11.

---

## 39. Public Header No Admin Rule

Search public UI for:

* `/admin`
* “Admin”
* “Staff”
* “Super Admin”
* provider settings links
* internal tools

None should appear in public header/footer.

Admin route can exist but must be separate and hidden from public UI.

If public admin link exists:

* remove it
* create bug
* update security checklist

---

## 40. Existing Design Preservation Test

Before finalizing, compare with existing UI.

Verify:

* existing header still present if it existed
* existing city selector still present if it existed
* existing guest/owner header behavior preserved or improved safely
* old hero was not used to replace header
* homepage not visually broken
* no large unexpected redesign
* no working feature removed

If any approved UI changed significantly:

* document reason
* create rollback note
* ask approval if major

---

## 41. Component Structure Recommendation

Use/align with current structure.

Possible components:

```txt id="public-ui-components"
components/layout/PublicLayout.tsx
components/layout/PublicHeader.tsx
components/layout/PublicFooter.tsx
components/public/HomeHeroSearch.tsx
components/public/CitySelector.tsx
components/public/HomeRoleCards.tsx
components/public/HomeHowItWorks.tsx
components/public/HomeDisclaimer.tsx
components/auth/AuthTrigger.tsx
```

Do not create duplicates if components already exist.

Prefer small reusable components.

---

## 42. State Handling Requirements

Every public UI interactive module must have states where relevant:

* loading
* empty
* error
* unauthorized
* setup-required
* disabled
* success

Examples:

* auth provider setup-required
* city list unavailable
* search route placeholder
* profile menu loading
* notification no-data
* CTA disabled because feature later phase

No blank broken sections.

---

## 43. Performance Requirements

Public UI must:

* avoid heavy client JS
* keep homepage fast
* avoid loading admin/dashboard code
* avoid loading maps
* avoid loading payment scripts
* avoid loading analytics SDK if not configured
* lazy-load non-critical sections if needed
* optimize images
* reduce layout shift
* avoid huge hero image
* use server components where suitable
* keep interactive components minimal

No heavy provider scripts in this phase.

---

## 44. Image Rules

If homepage uses images:

* use optimized image component if available
* include width/height
* include alt text
* no distorted images
* no huge unoptimized image
* no fake property/project image as real listing
* no copyrighted images unless already allowed
* use abstract/brand-safe graphics if needed

If no image asset exists, use clean CSS/card layout instead.

---

## 45. Error Handling

Errors must be safe.

Do not show:

* raw SQL error
* raw provider error
* secret values
* stack traces
* hidden contact
* private profile data

Show user-safe errors:

```txt id="safe-error-examples"
Something went wrong. Please try again.
Search is not fully connected yet.
Authentication provider setup required.
Location data is not available yet.
```

---

## 46. Build/Lint/Typecheck Requirements

Run available checks:

```txt id="checks"
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm test
```

or package manager equivalent.

If script missing, document `NOT_CONFIGURED`.

If command fails:

* fix safe issues
* create bug if not fixed
* do not mark PASS

---

## 47. Manual Smoke Checks

If app runs, manually check:

* homepage loads
* header visible
* city selector visible
* brand not broken
* login/register visible for guest
* login/register hidden for logged-in user if test user available
* dashboard link appears for logged-in role if available
* admin link not visible publicly
* hero search visible below header
* search routes to `/search`
* footer visible on public page
* footer not visible on dashboard if dashboard layout exists
* no dead links
* no `href="#"`
* no fake counts
* no horizontal scroll at common mobile widths
* no console crash

Record results.

Full verification in matching manual prompt.

---

## 48. SQL Migration Rule

Prompt 03 should normally not require DB migration.

If DB changes are necessary:

* create migration under `supabase/migrations/`
* include purpose comments
* include rollback notes
* explain why UI phase needed DB change
* update security/deployment docs

Avoid DB changes in this phase unless absolutely needed.

---

## 49. API Provider Status Updates

Update `API_PROVIDER_STATUS.md` only if provider status changes.

Possible updates:

* Auth provider setup-required state used in UI
* Location provider not started/setup-required
* Maps API not used
* Notifications not started/setup-required
* Analytics not used/setup-required

Do not mark provider active.

---

Update `FEATURE_REGISTRY.md` for:

* public layout
* homepage
