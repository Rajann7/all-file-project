## 4. Core Product Principles

The project must follow these principles at all times.

### 4.1 Real Data Only

The website must not show fake:

* properties
* projects
* requirements
* leads
* views
* inquiries
* analytics
* payments
* subscriptions
* invoices
* verified badges
* RERA status
* reviews
* ratings
* city counts
* listing counts
* ad impressions
* ad clicks
* provider health
* notification delivery
* user activity
* success messages

If real data does not exist, show:

* empty state
* setup-required state
* pending state
* blocked state
* disabled state
* explanatory state

Never fake success.

---

### 4.2 No Hidden Contact Leak

Hidden contact numbers must never leak to unauthorized users.

Hidden/private contact must not appear in:

* public card
* detail page
* public profile
* page source
* API response
* server component payload
* metadata
* Open Graph
* schema markup
* sitemap
* share text
* notification
* logs
* analytics
* error tracking
* export file
* unauthorized dashboard
* unauthorized admin panel

Contact reveal must be authenticated, consent-aware, logged and rate-limited where required.

---

### 4.3 No Frontend-Only Security

Security must be enforced at:

* database level through RLS where applicable
* server action/API level
* route middleware/guards
* role and permission checks
* backend validation
* storage bucket policy
* provider webhook verification

UI hiding is helpful but never enough.

---

### 4.4 Mobile First

Every public page, dashboard, admin page and popup must work properly on mobile.

Required widths:

* 320px
* 360px
* 390px
* 430px
* 768px
* 1024px
* 1366px
* ultra-wide where relevant

The website must avoid:

* horizontal scroll
* overlapping content
* unreadable text
* broken cards
* broken modals
* broken bottom sheets
* tiny tap targets
* tables that do not convert to mobile cards
* sticky buttons covering content
* brand wrapping

The brand text **My Gujarat Property** must not break/wrap badly in header.

---

### 4.5 Role-Aware Experience

The website must change experience based on:

* guest
* owner
* broker/agent
* builder/developer
* Super Admin
* admin
* staff role
* suspended/banned user
* unverified user
* verified user
* expired subscription user
* setup-required provider state

Each user must see only what they are allowed to see.

---

### 4.6 Approval-First Marketplace

User-generated public marketplace content must be controlled by approval where required.

Approval applies to:

* property create
* property edit/update
* project create
* project edit/update
* requirement create
* requirement edit/update
* ads/promotions
* verification documents
* role change requests
* location missing requests
* CMS/legal/SEO publish where staff permissions apply

Pause/resume may not require approval if no public content changes, but must still be permission-controlled.

---

### 4.7 Provider Safe Mode

External providers must not be assumed working.

If provider is missing, the website must show safe state.

Provider-backed features include:

* OTP
* SMS
* email
* WhatsApp
* Razorpay
* Google Maps
* Cloudflare R2
* Cloudflare CDN
* Turnstile
* analytics
* error tracking
* cron/background jobs
* media processing
* file scanning
* PDF generation
* web push
* GeoIP
* Search Console

Missing provider state must be:

* `SETUP_REQUIRED`
* `DISABLED_BY_FLAG`
* `BLOCKED`
* `FALLBACK_ACTIVE`
* `NOT_STARTED`

Never fake provider success.

---

### 4.8 Documentation Is Source Of Truth

The generated documentation pack must stay aligned with implementation.

Important root docs:

* `CLAUDE.md`
* `brain.md`
* `FEATURE_REGISTRY.md`
* `CHANGELOG.md`
* `BUGS_AND_FIXES.md`
* `MANUAL_VERIFICATION.md`
* `API_PROVIDER_STATUS.md`
* `DEPLOYMENT_ROLLBACK.md`
* `SECURITY_RLS_CHECKLIST.md`
* `PERFORMANCE_CHECKLIST.md`

Every phase must update relevant docs.

No feature should silently disappear between:

* docs
* prompts
* code
* SQL migrations
* RLS policies
* verification
* deployment
* production launch
