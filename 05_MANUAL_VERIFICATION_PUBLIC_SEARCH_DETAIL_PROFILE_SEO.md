# My Gujarat Property — Prompt 05 Manual Verification: Public Search, Detail Pages, Profiles And SEO

This prompt is for Claude Code.

Use this prompt immediately after completing:

```txt id="matching-implementation-prompt"
prompts/05_PUBLIC_SEARCH_DETAIL_PROFILE_SEO.md
```

This prompt verifies the **Public Search, Detail Pages, Public Profiles and SEO Foundation** phase.

Do not skip this verification.

Do not start Prompt 06 until this verification is complete or the project owner/Super Admin explicitly accepts a documented `PARTIAL`, `BLOCKED` or `SETUP_REQUIRED` state.

Do not mark PASS without real public-safe data, hidden-contact, SEO, route, search, profile and responsive checks.

Do not fake PASS.

If unbounded search query exists:

* create bug
* mark `PARTIAL` or `FAIL`

---

## 44. Caching Verification

Verify caching does not leak private data.

Allowed:

* static SEO helpers

Not allowed:

* draft/private rows cached publicly
* hidden contact cached

If caching private data risk exists:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 45. Build / Lint / Typecheck Verification

Run available checks.

Examples:

npm run build
npm test
```

```txt id="pnpm-checks"
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

If scripts missing:

* record `NOT_CONFIGURED`

If checks fail:

* fix safe issues if in scope
* create bug if unresolved
* mark `FAIL` or `PARTIAL`

Build failure blocks PASS.

---

## 46. Migration Apply/Test Verification

If Prompt 05 created migration:

* apply migration in safe local/staging environment
* verify views exist
* verify indexes exist
* verify RLS unchanged/safe
* verify public-safe views exclude private fields

/project/[published-slug]
/project/[draft-or-rejected-slug]
/broker/[public-slug]
/builder/[public-slug]
/sitemap.xml

## 59. Verification Result Decision

Use these rules.

### PASS

Mark `PASS` only if:

* build passes
* `/search` loads and handles params safely
* search uses public-safe data
* pagination/limits exist
* property detail shows only published safe entity
* project detail shows only published safe entity
* requirement detail behavior is safe
* broker profile safe
* builder profile safe
* hidden contact absent from UI/source/metadata/schema/sitemap
* unpublished/draft/pending/rejected/deleted entities not public
* no fake listings/counts/badges/reviews
* SEO metadata safe
* noindex rules safe
* canonical safe
* sitemap/robots safe if implemented
* responsive checks completed
* docs updated
* no blocking bugs

### PARTIAL

Use `PARTIAL` if:

* search works with limited filters
* sitemap not implemented yet but no private sitemap leak exists
* schema minimal only
* requirement public behavior deferred/scoped safely
* media placeholders only
* analytics/Search Console setup-required
* some responsive/cross-browser checks pending
* RLS runtime tests unavailable but public-safe code reviewed
* some profile pages noindex due to thin content

Prompt 06 can start only if user/Super Admin accepts partial and no critical privacy/security issue exists.

### FAIL

Use `FAIL` if:

* build fails
* hidden contact leaks
* public draft/pending/rejected row visible
* fake data appears real
* fake counts shown
* fake verified/RERA/reviews shown
* search route crashes
* unsafe query/sort injection risk
* unbounded search query
* public-safe view leaks private data
* sitemap includes private/unapproved URLs
* metadata/schema includes private data
* DB changes missing migration
* service role/provider secret exposed

Do not start Prompt 06.

### BLOCKED

Use `BLOCKED` if:

* Prompt 04 entity foundation failed
* public-safe views unavailable and cannot be safely created
* cannot inspect required files
* package/build baseline broken
* database unavailable blocks all meaningful verification
* architecture conflict needs owner decision
* required Prompt 05 files missing

### SETUP_REQUIRED

Use `SETUP_REQUIRED` for:

* Supabase database/RLS runtime missing
* media provider missing
* analytics/Search Console missing
* CMS/legal missing
* maps/nearby missing
* contact/lead provider missing

Setup-required can coexist with `PARTIAL`.

---

## 60. Prompt 06 Readiness Checklist

Prompt 06 can start only if:

* Prompt 05 implementation completed
* Prompt 05 verification completed
* no critical public-safe/privacy bug open

## 63. If Verification Fails

If verification fails:

1. do not start Prompt 06
2. create/update bug entries
3. update `MANUAL_VERIFICATION.md`
4. update `SECURITY_RLS_CHECKLIST.md`
5. update `PERFORMANCE_CHECKLIST.md`
6. update `DEPLOYMENT_ROLLBACK.md`
7. update `brain.md`
8. state exact blocker
9. fix if safe and in scope
10. rerun verification
11. only then proceed

Critical privacy/security/SEO leaks block progress.

---

## 64. If Verification Is Partial

If verification is partial:

* document exact partial items

Acceptable partial examples:

* limited filters
* sitemap deferred
* schema minimal only
* requirement public detail scoped/noindex
* media placeholder only
* Search Console/analytics setup-required
* some browser tests not done

Not acceptable partial without fix:

* hidden contact leak
* public draft leak

* bypass RLS/public-safe views
* ignore unbounded query
* ignore build failure
* start Prompt 06 after FAIL/BLOCKED

---

## 67. Quality Bar

This verification is successful when future phases can trust that:

* public search is safe
* public detail pages show only published safe data
* broker/builder profiles are public-safe
