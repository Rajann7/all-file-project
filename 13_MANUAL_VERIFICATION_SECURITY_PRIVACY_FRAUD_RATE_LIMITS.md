# My Gujarat Property — Prompt 13 Manual Verification: Security, Privacy, Fraud And Rate Limits

This prompt is for Claude Code.

Use this prompt immediately after completing:

```txt id="matching-implementation-prompt"
prompts/13_SECURITY_PRIVACY_FRAUD_RATE_LIMITS.md
```

This prompt verifies the **Security, Privacy, Fraud And Rate Limits** phase.

Do not skip this verification.

Do not start Prompt 14 until this verification is complete or the project owner/Super Admin explicitly accepts a documented `PARTIAL`, `BLOCKED` or `SETUP_REQUIRED` state.

Do not mark PASS without real route/API guard checks, RLS checks, hidden contact checks, provider secret checks, service role checks, rate-limit checks, fraud/spam/scraping checks, webhook checks, upload/payment/provider security checks, private noindex/cache checks, docs updates and build checks.

Do not fake PASS.

## 2. Verification Purpose

The purpose of this verification phase is to confirm that the whole platform is hardened against private data leaks, role bypasses, direct URL bypasses, RLS mistakes, provider secret leaks, hidden contact leaks, fake security claims, spam, fraud, scraping, unsafe webhooks and unsafe public/private boundaries.

This verification checks:

* route protection inventory
* API route classification
* authentication guards
* role guards
* admin/staff permission guards
* direct URL bypass denial
* disabled/suspended/deleted account denial
* admin separation
* public/admin login separation
* RLS final pass
* private table protection
* public-safe views
* sensitive field classification
* hidden contact protection
* private media protection
* private document protection
* lead/message/proposal/site visit privacy
* billing/payment/GST privacy
* notification/provider/ad privacy
* CMS/blog/legal draft privacy
* provider secret masking
* service role server-only usage
* environment variable safety
* input validation
* output sanitization
* CMS/rich text XSS prevention
* security headers
* CSP foundation
* CORS hardening
* CSRF foundation
* SSRF prevention
* open redirect prevention
* rate-limit foundation
* OTP/login abuse protection
* inquiry/contact/message/proposal/site visit rate limits
* upload/media rate limits
* payment/billing rate limits
* ad/notification/provider rate limits
* search/scraping limits
* spam prevention
* fraud report foundation
* suspicious activity logging
* block/report hardening
* audit log hardening
* log redaction
* webhook security
* payment security review
* upload security review
* provider security review
* SEO/CMS security review
* private noindex/no-store
* retention/deletion/privacy request foundation
* backup/restore readiness docs
* incident response docs
* docs updates
* Prompt 14 readiness

This phase does not verify final external penetration test, final WAF production setup, final SOC2/ISO compliance, full SIEM integration, final external security audit, full malware scanning vendor, final disaster recovery drill, or final production load/security test. Those are later or operational checks.

If DB changed without migration:

* create critical bug
* mark verification `FAIL`
* do not start Prompt 14

If migration exists without rollback notes:

* create bug
* mark `PARTIAL` or `FAIL` depending security/data risk

If DB not changed because Supabase/env unavailable:

* mark DB/RLS runtime checks `SETUP_REQUIRED`

* authorization requirement
* rate-limit requirement
* safe error handling
* no secrets in response
* no private data leak
* no raw stack traces

provider active
fake rate limit
mock security
demo fraud
TODO security
```

Check:

* statuses backed by code/tests/config
* setup-required/partial where not fully implemented
* no fake PASS in docs
* provider statuses honest
* backup tested only if tested
* malware scan active only if provider exists

If fake security status appears:

* create bug
* mark `PARTIAL` or `FAIL`

---

## 71. Automated Checks To Run

Run available:

```txt id="npm-checks"
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm test
```

or package manager equivalent.

If available, also run:

```txt id="optional-security-checks"
npm audit
pnpm audit
npm run test:security
npm run test:rls
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:auth
npm run test:permissions
npm run test:webhooks
```

If scripts missing:

* record `NOT_CONFIGURED`

If checks fail:

* fix safe issues if in scope
* create bug if unresolved
* mark `FAIL` or `PARTIAL`

Build failure blocks PASS.

---

## 72. Secret Scan Suggestions

Run/search:

```txt id="secret-scan-suggestions"
grep -R "SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" .
grep -R "RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET" .
grep -R "R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" .
grep -R "CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" .
grep -R "WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_TOKEN" .
grep -R "SENDGRID_API_KEY" .
grep -R "RESEND_API_KEY" .
grep -R "SMTP_PASSWORD" .
grep -R "OTP_API_KEY" .
grep -R "SERVICE_ROLE" .
```

Use equivalent project-safe search.

Do not print real secret values.

If found:

* classify context
* confirm if placeholder or real
* fix if unsafe
* create bug
* recommend rotation if real exposed

---

## 73. Hidden Contact Scan Suggestions

Run/search public output/code for:

```txt id="hidden-contact-scan-suggestions"
contact_phone
contact_email
owner_phone
broker_phone
builder_phone
hidden_contact
contact_visibility
mobile
whatsapp
tel:
mailto:
wa.me
```

Verify public surfaces exclude hidden contact.

Public surfaces:

* search cards
* detail pages
* SEO metadata
* schema
* sitemap
* notifications
* ads
* media metadata
* public API payloads

If hidden contact appears in public:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 74. RLS Test Suggestions

If Supabase test environment is available, run representative tests:

```txt id="rls-test-scenarios"
1. Anonymous select private profiles fields → denied.
2. Anonymous select public listing view → safe fields only.
3. Owner A select Owner B draft property → denied.
4. Broker A select Broker B property private fields → denied.
5. Builder A select Builder B project draft → denied.
6. User A select User B lead → denied.
7. User A select non-participant message thread → denied.
8. User A select User B invoice → denied.
9. User A select User B notification → denied.
10. Builder A select Builder B ad campaign → denied.
11. Anonymous select provider_configurations → denied.
12. Anonymous select audit logs → denied.
13. Staff without billing permission select payment data → denied.
14. Staff without provider permission select provider logs → denied.
15. Staff without legal permission publish legal page → denied.
16. Public select private media metadata → denied.
17. Public select CMS drafts → denied.
18. Public select consent records → denied.
```

Record exact results.

Do not mark RLS PASS without tests.

---

## 75. Manual Smoke Test Matrix

If app can run, test:

```txt id="manual-smoke-matrix"
Auth/role:
- guest denied dashboard
- guest denied admin
- owner denied broker/builder/admin private pages
- broker denied builder/admin private pages
- builder denied owner/broker/admin private pages
- staff without permission denied provider/security/billing pages
- disabled staff denied admin

Private data:
- wrong user denied lead/message/proposal/site visit
- wrong user denied invoice/payment/GST
- wrong user denied notification
- wrong user denied ad campaign
- wrong user denied private media/doc signed URL

Public privacy:
- public search has no hidden contact
- public detail has no hidden contact
- metadata/schema/sitemap has no hidden contact
- private/admin/dashboard pages absent from sitemap

Secrets:
- provider secrets not in UI
- service role not in client
- .env.example placeholders only

Security:
- invalid webhook rejected
- invalid upload rejected
- open redirect blocked
- unsafe CMS HTML blocked
- rate limit blocks after threshold if configured
- private pages noindex/no-store
```

If safe runtime unavailable:

* inspect code
* mark runtime tests `SETUP_REQUIRED` or `PARTIAL`
* do not fake runtime PASS

---

## 76. Responsive / UI Security State Verification

Security pages/UI states should work on:

```txt id="responsive-widths"
320px
360px
390px
430px
768px
1024px
1366px
```

Check:

* forbidden/unauthorized pages readable
* rate limit errors readable
* security settings pages fit if any
* privacy request pages fit if any
* fraud report pages fit
* admin audit/security tables become cards
* provider secret masked fields fit

## 87. Verification Result Decision

Use these rules.

### PASS

Mark `PASS` only if:

* build passes
* route inventory completed
* API route classification completed
* private routes guarded server-side
* role/admin boundaries enforced
* disabled/suspended users handled
* direct URL bypass does not leak private data
* RLS enabled/reviewed/tested for private tables
* public views expose only safe fields
* hidden contact absent from public surfaces
* private media/docs protected
* wrong-user private data denied
* service role server-only
* provider secrets not exposed
* input validation present for critical mutations
* CMS/rich content sanitized
* open redirect blocked
* webhook security reviewed and critical webhooks safe
* upload/payment/provider security reviewed
* rate-limit foundation exists and critical endpoints covered or honestly setup-required without active abuse exposure
* fraud/spam/scraping foundation exists
* logs redact secrets/OTP/tokens
* audit logs cover high-risk actions or gaps documented
* private pages noindex/no-store
* retention/backup/incident docs updated
* docs updated
* no critical security/privacy bugs open

### PARTIAL

Use `PARTIAL` if:

* CSP is report-only/foundation
* durable rate limit store setup-required
* fraud detection foundation partial
* captcha/WAF setup-required
* malware scan setup-required
* backup restore test setup-required
* incident response docs foundation only
* RLS runtime tests unavailable but policies reviewed
* provider webhook runtime testing pending
* external security audit pending
* responsive/browser checks incomplete
* no active critical leak/bypass/secret exposure exists

Prompt 14 can start only if user/Super Admin accepts partial and no critical security/privacy issue exists.

### FAIL

Use `FAIL` if:

* build fails
* service role in client
* provider secret exposed
* hidden contact leak
* public admin access
* direct URL bypass leaks private data
* wrong-user private data access
* RLS missing on private table
* public select on private table
* frontend-only authorization on private mutation
* private media/doc public
* payment webhook bypass
* unsafe provider webhook mutates data
* unsafe CMS HTML executes
* open redirect exists
* raw secrets/OTP/tokens in logs
* private pages indexed with data
* DB changes missing migration

Do not start Prompt 14.

### BLOCKED

Use `BLOCKED` if:

* previous phase verification failed and security depends on it
* Supabase/RLS unavailable blocks final pass
* architecture conflict requires owner decision
* provider secret management unresolved
* route/API inventory impossible due to missing structure
* rate limit store unavailable and production decision depends on it
* cannot inspect required files
* package/build baseline broken

### SETUP_REQUIRED

Use `SETUP_REQUIRED` for:

* durable rate limit store missing
* captcha/WAF provider missing
* malware scanner missing
* error monitoring missing
* backup provider/setup missing
* cron cleanup/retention jobs missing
* CSP reporting endpoint missing
* external security audit missing
* production env/security headers not deployed
* Supabase env missing
* test users/admin roles unavailable

Setup-required is acceptable only when no active critical leak/bypass remains.

---

## 91. If Verification Fails

If verification fails:

1. do not start Prompt 14
2. create/update bug entries
3. update `MANUAL_VERIFICATION.md`
4. update `SECURITY_RLS_CHECKLIST.md`
5. update `PERFORMANCE_CHECKLIST.md`
6. update `DEPLOYMENT_ROLLBACK.md`
7. update `API_PROVIDER_STATUS.md` if provider/security issue found
8. update `brain.md`
9. state exact blocker
10. fix if safe and in scope
11. rerun verification
12. only then proceed

Critical security/privacy failures block progress.

---

## 92. If Verification Is Partial

If verification is partial:

* document exact partial items
* list setup-required providers/infrastructure
* list RLS runtime gaps
* list rate-limit/fraud gaps
* list CSP/header gaps
* list backup/incident gaps
* list external audit gaps
* confirm no service role client exposure
* confirm no provider secret leak
* confirm no hidden contact leak
* confirm no public admin
* confirm no direct URL private data leak
* confirm no wrong-user private data access
* confirm no private table missing RLS
* confirm no private media/doc public
* confirm no payment webhook bypass
* confirm no unsafe CMS HTML/open redirect
* update docs
* ask/require owner acceptance before Prompt 14 if risk is significant

Acceptable partial examples:

* durable rate limit store setup-required but helper/foundation exists
* CSP report-only
* WAF/captcha setup-required
* malware scan setup-required
* external security audit not done
* backup restore test not done
* incident response docs foundation only
* RLS runtime tests unavailable but policies reviewed

Not acceptable partial without fix:

* provider secret leak
* service role client exposure
* hidden contact leak
* public admin access
* wrong-user private data access
* direct URL private data leak
* private media/doc public
* RLS missing on private table
* payment webhook bypass
* unsafe CMS HTML
* open redirect
* build fail

---

## 93. If Verification Passes

If verification passes:

* update `MANUAL_VERIFICATION.md` with PASS
* update `FEATURE_REGISTRY.md`
* update `CHANGELOG.md`
* update `SECURITY_RLS_CHECKLIST.md`
* update `PERFORMANCE_CHECKLIST.md`
* update `DEPLOYMENT_ROLLBACK.md`
* update `API_PROVIDER_STATUS.md` if relevant
* update `brain.md`
* final response should say Prompt 14 can start

Do not start Prompt 14 automatically unless user asked to continue.

---

## 94. What Not To Do In This Verification

Do not:

* disable RLS to make tests pass
* bypass backend permissions
* ignore direct URL bypass
* ignore provider secret leaks
* ignore service role exposure
* ignore hidden contact leaks
* mark rate limits active if fake
* mark fraud protection active if fake
* mark webhook verified if untested/unimplemented
* mark backup tested if not tested
* mark CSP complete if only placeholder
* expose secrets in final response
* paste raw private logs
* start Prompt 14 after FAIL/BLOCKED

---

## 95. Quality Bar

This verification is successful when future phases can trust that:

* route guards are server-side
* role/admin boundaries are enforced
* direct URL bypasses are blocked
* private data is RLS-protected
* hidden contact is protected everywhere
* private media/docs remain private
* provider secrets are server-only
* service role is server-only
* critical inputs are validated
* rich content is sanitized
* web security headers/CSP foundation exists
* open redirects are blocked
* critical webhooks are verified/idempotent or honestly setup-required
* critical abuse endpoints have rate-limit foundation
* spam/scraping/fraud foundations exist
* logs redact sensitive data
* audit logs cover high-risk actions or gaps are documented
* backup/incident docs are updated
* no fake security status exists
