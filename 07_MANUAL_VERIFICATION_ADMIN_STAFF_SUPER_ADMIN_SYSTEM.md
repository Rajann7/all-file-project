# My Gujarat Property — Prompt 07 Manual Verification: Admin, Staff And Super Admin System

This prompt is for Claude Code.

Use this prompt immediately after completing:

```txt id="matching-implementation-prompt"
prompts/07_ADMIN_STAFF_SUPER_ADMIN_SYSTEM.md
```

This prompt verifies the **Admin, Staff and Super Admin System** phase.

Do not skip this verification.

Do not start Prompt 08 until this verification is complete or the project owner/Super Admin explicitly accepts a documented `PARTIAL`, `BLOCKED` or `SETUP_REQUIRED` state.

Do not mark PASS without real admin access, staff permission, moderation, secret masking, RLS, noindex, audit, responsive and docs checks.

Do not fake PASS.

* permission-aware navigation
* moderation queues
* property approval/rejection/request-changes
* project approval/rejection/request-changes
* requirement approval/rejection/request-changes
* user management foundation
* staff management foundation
* verification review foundation
* support/report/fraud placeholders
* billing/payment placeholders
* provider/settings placeholders
* provider secret masking

* sensitive data protection
* private document protection
* direct URL denial
* RLS for admin/staff tables
* no fake admin data/actions
* responsive admin UI

  * expired
* execution audited
* rejection reason captured
* Super Admin override audited
* same staff cannot approve own critical request unless allowed/audited

If maker-checker not implemented, ensure high-risk actions are either disabled, Super Admin-only, or documented as `PARTIAL`.

Do not fake maker-checker approval.

---

## 36. Internal Notes / Timeline Verification

If internal notes/timeline implemented:

* private to admin/staff with permission
* public users cannot see notes
* notes audited if sensitive
* no provider secrets in notes
* no private docs stored raw
* deletion restricted or soft-hidden
* no fake internal notes
* safe professional content guidance

If internal notes appear in public dashboard/detail page:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 37. Sensitive Data Access Verification

Sensitive data includes:

* phone/email
* private address
* verification docs
* RERA proof docs
* identity docs
* billing/payment info
* support attachments
* fraud reports
* internal notes
* audit logs
* provider config
* service role keys
* admin/staff permissions

Verify:

* sensitive data masked by default
* `view_sensitive` permission required
* sensitive view action audited
* export permission required
* private docs not public
* unauthorized staff denied
* no sensitive data in raw errors/logs

If sensitive data broadly visible to all staff:

* create bug
* mark `FAIL` or `PARTIAL` depending severity

---

## 38. Export / Bulk Action Verification

If export/bulk actions implemented:

* permission required
* sensitive export separate
* export audited
* batch size limited
* confirmation required
* high-risk bulk action maker-checker if implemented
* no fake export success
* no private docs unless explicit permission
* no provider secrets
* no unbounded export

If not implemented:

* hidden or setup/coming soon

If export works without permission:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 39. Admin Search / Filter Verification

Verify admin tables:

* pagination
* safe search
* safe filters
* no unbounded reads
* no unsafe raw SQL
* no sensitive export through normal search
* filters are real or disabled
* mobile filter usable
* status/role/date filters safe

If admin user list loads all users unbounded:

* create bug
* mark `PARTIAL` or `FAIL`

---

## 40. Admin Noindex Verification

Verify admin/internal routes:

* noindex/nofollow metadata where appropriate
* excluded from sitemap
* not linked from public UI
* robots disallow where appropriate
* no private/admin metadata in public schema

Noindex is not security. Route guards must still work.

If admin routes are indexable and public route-accessible:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

If admin routes are protected but noindex missing:

* create bug
* mark `PARTIAL`

---

## 41. Private Cache Verification

Admin pages are private.

Verify:

* no static generation of admin private data
* no public caching of admin pages
* no cached staff data shared between users
* no provider/audit/user data in public cache
* `no-store` or equivalent where needed
* admin URLs not in public sitemap

If admin private data can be publicly cached:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 42. Service Role / Secret Verification

Search admin code and client bundles for:

```txt id="secret-patterns"
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
SERVICE_ROLE
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET
RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
R2_SECRET
OTP_API_KEY
SMS_API_KEY
WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_TOKEN
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
SENDGRID_API_KEY
RESEND_API_KEY
TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY
```

Verify:

* service role not in client
* provider secrets not in UI
* no real secrets in `.env.example`
* no secrets in logs
* no raw secrets in audit logs
* no secrets in provider settings response
* no secrets printed in docs/final output

If real secret exposure found:

* do not print secret
* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`
* recommend secret rotation

---

## 43. RLS Verification For Admin Tables

If admin/staff tables exist, verify RLS enabled.

Check:

```txt id="admin-tables-rls"
staff_profiles
staff_permissions
staff_invites
admin_audit_logs
admin_action_requests
admin_action_approvals
entity_moderation_notes
entity_status_events
admin_internal_notes
admin_saved_views
admin_exports
```

Expected:

* public denied
* public users denied
* staff access permission-scoped
* Super Admin access allowed
* sensitive data permission-scoped
* audit logs protected
* staff cannot self-grant
* disabled staff denied by server logic
* service role server-only

If RLS missing on private admin table:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

If database unavailable:

* mark RLS runtime check `SETUP_REQUIRED`
* do not mark RLS PASS

---

## 44. RLS Test Suggestions

If Supabase test environment is available, run equivalent scenarios:

```txt id="rls-test-scenarios"
1. Anonymous select staff_profiles → denied.
2. Public owner select staff_profiles → denied.
3. Staff select own staff_profile → allowed if policy permits.
4. Staff select all staff_profiles without permission → denied.
5. Staff select staff_permissions of others without permission → denied.
6. Staff update own permission → denied.
7. Super Admin update staff permission → allowed.
8. Staff without property approval permission approve property → denied.
9. Staff with property approval permission approve property → allowed.
10. Public select admin_audit_logs → denied.
11. Staff without audit permission select audit logs → denied.
12. Audit manager/Super Admin select audit logs → allowed.
13. Staff without provider permission select provider settings → denied or masked.
```

Record exact results.

Do not mark RLS PASS without tests.

---

## 45. Migration Verification

If Prompt 07 changed DB, verify migration exists:

```txt id="migration-name"

```

Migration must include:

* purpose
* phase: Prompt 07
* tables created/changed
* views created/changed
* RLS policies created/changed
* indexes created
* functions/triggers if any
* destructive changes yes/no
* backup required yes/no
* rollback notes

If migration has no rollback notes:

* create bug
* mark `PARTIAL` or `FAIL` depending risk

---

## 46. Responsive Admin UI Verification

1024px
1366px
```

Check:

* admin login fits
* admin sidebar collapses/drawer
* no horizontal scroll
* admin tables become cards

* actions usable
* modals fit screen
* detail drawers fit
* permission disabled states visible
* sensitive reveal controls usable

* no N+1 heavy queries
* no heavy fake charts
* provider SDKs not loaded unnecessarily
* no maps/payment/media scripts unless needed

If admin loads all users/entities without pagination:

* create bug
* mark `PARTIAL` or `FAIL`

---

## 49. Build / Lint / Typecheck Verification

Run available checks.

Examples:

npm run build
npm test
```

```txt id="pnpm-checks"
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

If scripts missing:

* record `NOT_CONFIGURED`

If checks fail:

* fix safe issues if in scope
* create bug if unresolved
* mark `FAIL` or `PARTIAL`

Build failure blocks PASS.

* maker-checker foundation partial
* audit logs partial
* RLS runtime tests unavailable but policies/migration reviewed

Do not start Prompt 08.

### BLOCKED

Use `BLOCKED` if:

* Prompt 02 admin auth foundation failed
* auth/session unavailable blocks admin verification
* Supabase/RLS unavailable blocks secure admin verification
* cannot inspect required files
* package/build baseline broken
* architecture conflict needs owner decision

## 66. If Verification Fails

If verification fails:

1. do not start Prompt 08
2. create/update bug entries
3. update `MANUAL_VERIFICATION.md`
4. update `SECURITY_RLS_CHECKLIST.md`
5. update `PERFORMANCE_CHECKLIST.md`
6. update `DEPLOYMENT_ROLLBACK.md`

* Super Admin/Admin/Staff are separated
* staff permissions are server-enforced
* moderation actions are permission-protected
* provider secrets are masked
* sensitive data is protected
* audit logs are safe or honestly partial
* maker-checker is safe or honestly partial
* admin pages are noindex and privately cached
* RLS protects internal tables
* admin UI works on mobile
* docs reflect reality
