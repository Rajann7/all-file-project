## 2. Core Principles

The system must follow these principles:

1. Ads must show only when approved, paid where required, active and not expired.
2. Builder ads must be linked to builder-owned approved projects.
3. Public ads must clearly show sponsored/promoted label.
4. RERA/compliance must be respected for project promotions.
5. Ad impressions and clicks must be real only.
6. No fake ad analytics are allowed.
7. Notifications must be DB-backed.
8. Unread counts must be real.
9. External notification delivery must be real or setup-required.
10. Provider secrets must never be exposed.
11. Missing providers must show setup-required/fallback.
12. Client-side provider success cannot be trusted for sensitive flows.
13. Webhooks must verify signatures where provider supports it.
14. Provider events must be idempotent.
15. Provider failures must be logged safely.
16. Provider fallbacks must not fake success.
17. Admin provider controls must be permission-scoped.
18. Production cannot use test/mock provider behavior.
19. Every provider status must be tracked honestly.
20. Manual verification is required before PASS.

* R2 missing → upload disabled/setup-required.
* CDN missing → serve from storage if safe/configured or setup-required.
* GeoIP missing → manual city selector.
* Analytics missing → real DB counts only or setup-required.
* Cron missing → manual/admin warning or request-time checks.

Fallback cannot show “sent/delivered/paid/uploaded” unless real.

## 65. Index Expectations

Indexes required for:

* ads by builder
* ads by project
* ads by status
* ads by approval status
* ads by payment status
* ads by date range
* ad targets by city/location
* ad events by ad/date/type

* provider health checks by provider/date
* background jobs by status/next run
* dead letters by source/status

No ad/notification/provider admin table should be unpaginated.

---

## 66. RLS And Security Rules

RLS must enforce:

* builder sees own ad campaigns only
* builder can create ads only for own projects
* builder cannot access another builder’s ads
* public reads only eligible public ad data
* ad analytics visible to campaign owner/admin only
* notification recipient reads own notifications
* staff reads own internal notifications
* notification preferences user-owned
* delivery logs staff/admin permission-scoped
* provider settings admin/Super Admin only
* provider secrets not stored/exposed
* webhook events server/admin only
* ad admin actions permission-scoped
* feature flags admin/Super Admin only
* private media/doc rules respected
* hidden contact never in notifications unless authorized recipient and safe

---

## 67. Direct URL Bypass Tests

Test:

* builder accesses another builder ad
* owner accesses builder ads dashboard
* broker accesses builder ads dashboard
* guest accesses ads dashboard
* user accesses another user notifications
* user marks another user notification read
* user accesses provider admin
* staff without provider permission accesses provider admin
* staff without notification permission edits template
* public accesses delivery logs
* invalid webhook hits provider webhook
* ad displays when unpaid
* ad displays when pending approval
* ad displays when expired
* hidden contact appears in notification

All unauthorized must fail.

---

## 68. Provider And Notification Logging Rules

Do not log:

* API secrets
* webhook secrets
* OTP
* payment secrets
* hidden contact
* full phone/email when not necessary
* private document URL
* full provider payload with sensitive data
* service role key
* raw WhatsApp/email/SMS tokens
* push private keys

Safe logs:

* provider name
* event ID
* safe error code
* status
* attempt count
* timestamp
* redacted recipient
* notification ID
* campaign ID
* payment ID
* ad ID

---

## 69. Rate Limit Rules

Rate limits required for:

* ad event tracking
* ad click tracking
* ad campaign creation
* ad media upload
* provider health check test button
* provider webhook endpoint where applicable
* notification send test
* notification batch creation
* SMS send
* email send
* WhatsApp send
* OTP send/verify
* push registration
* contact reveal via provider link
* report abuse from ad/message

Rate limit failure must be safe.
