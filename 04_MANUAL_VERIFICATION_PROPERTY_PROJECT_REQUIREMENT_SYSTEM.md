# My Gujarat Property — Prompt 04 Manual Verification: Property, Project And Requirement System

This prompt is for Claude Code.

Use this prompt immediately after completing:

```txt id="matching-implementation-prompt"
prompts/04_PROPERTY_PROJECT_REQUIREMENT_SYSTEM.md
```

This prompt verifies the **Property, Project and Requirement System** phase.

Do not skip this verification.

Do not start Prompt 05 until this verification is complete or the project owner/Super Admin explicitly accepts a documented `PARTIAL`, `BLOCKED` or `SETUP_REQUIRED` state.

Do not mark PASS without real role, RLS, form, status, public-safe and security checks.

Do not fake PASS.

PERFORMANCE_CHECKLIST.md
brain.md
```

Record exact changed files.

---

## 7. Migration Verification

If Prompt 04 changed database schema, verify migration exists.

Expected pattern:

```txt id="expected-migration"
supabase/migrations/*_property_project_requirement_system.sql
```

Verify migration includes:

* purpose comment
* phase comment: Prompt 04
* tables created/changed
* views created/changed
* RLS policies created/changed
* indexes created
* functions/triggers if any
* destructive changes yes/no
* backup required yes/no
* rollback notes

If DB changed without migration:

* create critical bug
* mark verification `FAIL`
* do not start Prompt 05

If migration exists but no rollback notes:

* create bug
* mark `PARTIAL` or `FAIL` depending risk

If DB not changed because Supabase unavailable:

* mark DB/RLS runtime checks `SETUP_REQUIRED`
* do not claim RLS PASS

---

## 8. Expected Table Verification

If schema exists, check for entity tables or equivalent.

Expected/possible tables:

```txt id="expected-entity-tables"
properties
projects
project_units
requirements
entity_media_links
entity_status_events
entity_moderation_notes
```

Minimum expected for this phase:

* property entity storage
* project entity storage
* requirement entity storage
* ownership/profile link fields
* status/approval/visibility fields
* location fields foundation
* contact visibility foundation
* created/updated timestamps
* soft delete field
* RLS enabled

If implementation claims entity system is complete but tables are missing:

* create bug
* mark `FAIL` or `PARTIAL`

---

## 9. Property Schema Verification

Verify property schema supports:

* creator/owner profile

* timestamps
* soft delete

Verify property categories/types cover:

* residential
* commercial
* industrial
* land/plot
* PG/hostel/room
* business

If important categories are missing without documentation:

* create bug/task
* mark `PARTIAL`

---

## 10. Property Role Gate Verification

Verify:

| User        | Property Create                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Guest       | Denied                                     |
| Owner       | Allowed                                    |
| Broker      | Allowed                                    |
| Builder     | Denied                                     |
| Admin/Staff | Not public-user creation; moderation later |

Test/inspect:

* UI hides/blocks wrong role
* server action rejects wrong role
* RLS rejects wrong role if possible
* direct URL cannot bypass
* error is safe

If builder can create property:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 11. Property Form Verification

Verify property form:

* loads for owner/broker
* denied for guest/builder
* has purpose selector
* has category/type selector

* validates numeric ranges
* validates enum values
* validates location fields
* validates contact visibility
* has loading/error states
* has draft/submit behavior if implemented

* does not show fake approval
* mobile usable

Test examples:

* flat/apartment fields appear correctly
* plot/land fields appear correctly
* shop/office fields appear correctly
* industrial fields appear correctly
* PG/hostel fields appear correctly
* business fields appear correctly

If all dynamic categories are not complete, document `PARTIAL` and exact missing types.

---

## 12. Project Schema Verification

Verify project schema supports:

* builder profile
* project name
* slug
* project category
* project type
* purpose
* description
* price range
* total towers/wings/floors/units

* RERA fields
* amenities/specifications
* location hierarchy foundation
* status
* approval status
* visibility status
* review/rejection/need-changes fields
* timestamps
* soft delete

Verify forbidden project types are absent:

* PG
* hostel
* room
* paying guest
* single room
* shared room

If PG/hostel/room is allowed as project type:

* create bug
* mark `FAIL` if role/category rule is violated

---

## 13. Project Role Gate Verification

Verify:

| User        | Project Create                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Guest       | Denied                                     |
| Owner       | Denied                                     |
| Broker      | Denied                                     |
| Builder     | Allowed                                    |
| Admin/Staff | Moderation later, not public-user creation |

Test/inspect:

* owner denied project form
* broker denied project form
* builder allowed project form
* guest denied project form
* server action rejects wrong role
* RLS rejects wrong role if possible
* direct URL cannot bypass

If owner/broker can create project:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

If builder cannot create project due to broken gate:

* create bug
* mark `PARTIAL` or `FAIL`

---

## 14. Project Form Verification

Verify project form:

* loads for builder
* denied for guest/owner/broker
* has project type/category selector
* excludes PG/hostel/room
* captures location
* captures project details
* captures towers/wings/floors/units foundation
* captures RERA fields
* captures possession/timeline fields
* has media placeholder
* one-video rule foundation exists if video metadata exists
* validates required fields
* validates numeric ranges
* has loading/error states
* has draft/submit behavior if implemented
* mobile usable

If unit inventory is partial, record exact status.

---

## 15. Project Unit Inventory Verification

If `project_units` or equivalent exists, verify:

* units link to project
* builder owns project/units
* wrong builder denied
* unit type/area/price/status fields exist
* availability status is enum-safe
* no fake sold/booked/available claims
* public display is not enabled before project publish
* RLS protects units

Availability statuses should be safe:

```txt id="availability-statuses"
available
booked
sold
on_hold
not_released
hidden
```

If inventory not implemented, ensure it is documented `PARTIAL` or `NOT_STARTED`.

---

## 16. Requirement Schema Verification

Verify requirement schema supports:

* creator profile
* public role
* title
* slug
* purpose
* category
* requirement type
* budget/rent range
* area range
* location preferences
* property preferences
* contact visibility
* status
* approval status
* visibility status

* timestamps
* soft delete

Requirement categories should cover:

* residential
* commercial
* industrial
* land/plot
* PG/hostel/room
* business
* project if scoped

---

## 17. Requirement Role Gate Verification

Verify:

| User        | Requirement Create                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Guest       | Denied                                     |
| Owner       | Allowed                                    |
| Broker      | Allowed                                    |
| Builder     | Denied unless explicitly approved later    |
| Admin/Staff | Moderation later, not public-user creation |

Test/inspect:

* owner allowed requirement form
* broker allowed requirement form
* builder denied requirement form
* guest denied requirement form
* server action rejects wrong role
* RLS rejects wrong role if possible
* direct URL cannot bypass

If builder can create requirement without explicit product approval:

* create bug
* mark `FAIL` or `PARTIAL` depending implementation state

---

## 18. Requirement Form Verification

Verify requirement form:

* loads for owner/broker
* denied for guest/builder
* has purpose/category/type selector
* captures preferred location
* captures budget/rent
* captures area range
* captures key preferences
* validates ranges
* validates enum values
* hides irrelevant fields
* has loading/error states
* has draft/submit behavior if implemented
* does not expose contact publicly
* mobile usable

If requirement matching is not implemented, this is fine. Matching comes later.

---

## 19. Dynamic Field Verification

Verify dynamic forms hide irrelevant fields.

Examples:

* Rent-only fields hidden for sale-only property.
* Sale price hidden for pure rental where appropriate.
* PG rules appear only for PG/hostel/room.
* Business fields appear only for business type.
* Plot dimensions appear for land/plot.
* BHK fields not required for pure plot/land.
* Floor fields not required for agricultural land.
* Project tower/unit fields appear for project.
* PG/hostel/room not shown as project type.

If irrelevant fields are required incorrectly:

* create bug
* mark `PARTIAL` or `FAIL`

---

## 20. Validation Verification

Verify server-side validation exists for:

* role
* ownership
* title length
* slug safety
* purpose enum
* category enum
* type enum
* numeric ranges
* location fields
* contact visibility
* status transitions
* media count placeholders if any
* project one-video max if video metadata exists
* RERA fields if provided
* no unsafe HTML/scripts
* no invalid role override
* no hidden contact in public-safe fields where enforceable

Client-side validation alone is not enough.

If server action accepts invalid data:

* create bug
* mark `FAIL` or `PARTIAL`

---

## 21. Status Workflow Verification

Verify status transitions.

Expected flow:

```txt id="expected-status-flow"
draft → submitted
submitted → under_review
under_review → need_changes
under_review → approved
under_review → rejected
need_changes → submitted
approved → published
published → paused
paused → published
published → expired
published → deleted
draft → deleted
rejected → deleted
```

Check:

* user can save draft
* user can submit own draft
* user cannot approve own entity
* edit after published/approved creates review-needed state or documented status
* pause/resume allowed by owner/uploader
* pause/resume does not require reapproval
* soft delete works
* deleted item hidden
* invalid transition rejected

If any status transition is fake/hardcoded:

* create bug
* mark `PARTIAL` or `FAIL`

---

## 22. Approval Workflow Verification

Verify approval foundation:

* new submitted entity is not public
* approval status exists
* review fields exist
* rejection/need-changes reason exists
* admin/staff approval not faked
* user cannot self-approve
* approved/published timestamp fields exist or documented
* public-safe views include only published/approved
* full admin moderation UI deferred to Prompt 07 if not implemented

If entity becomes public immediately without approval:

* create bug
* mark `FAIL` unless product explicitly approved auto-publish with docs updated

---

## 23. Pause / Resume Verification

Verify:

* owner/broker can pause own property/requirement
* builder can pause own project
* wrong user cannot pause/resume
* guest cannot pause/resume
* paused entity is hidden or unavailable as defined
* resume returns to published/approved safe state
* pause/resume does not require reapproval
* status event/audit updated if implemented

If wrong user can pause/resume:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 24. Soft Delete Verification

Verify:

* user can soft delete own draft/rejected/published entity as allowed
* wrong user denied
* guest denied
* deleted_at/status updated
* deleted entity not public
* hard delete not available to normal user
* audit/status event updated if implemented
* restore/hard delete deferred if not in scope

If normal user can hard delete data unexpectedly:

* create bug
* mark `FAIL` or `PARTIAL`

---

## 25. Dashboard Management Verification

Verify management pages show own data only.

Check:

* owner sees own properties/requirements
* broker sees own properties/requirements
* builder sees own projects
* empty state if none
* no fake records
* statuses shown accurately
* edit/submit/pause/resume/delete actions available only where allowed
* wrong-role links hidden/denied
* list pagination foundation if many items
* table becomes mobile cards if needed
* no hidden contact leak

If wrong user items appear:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 26. Public-Safe View Verification

If public-safe views exist, verify:

```txt id="public-safe-views"
public_properties_view
public_projects_view
public_requirements_view
```

Check public views include only:

* approved/published entities
* public-safe fields
* safe location
* safe price/area/category/type
* safe media placeholders/public media only
* safe uploader public profile fields only

Public views must exclude:

* contact phone
* contact email
* private address if hidden
* draft/submitted/pending/under_review entities
* rejected/need_changes entities
* paused/deleted/expired entities unless explicitly public-unavailable
* admin review notes
* rejection reasons
* private media
* billing/plan data
* internal moderation fields
* private owner profile fields

If public-safe view leaks private data:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 27. RLS Enabled Verification

For every private table created/changed, verify RLS is enabled.

Check:

```txt id="rls-table-checks"
properties
projects
project_units
requirements
entity_media_links
entity_status_events
entity_moderation_notes
```

If RLS missing on private table:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

If DB unavailable:

* mark RLS runtime verification `SETUP_REQUIRED`
* do not mark RLS PASS

---

## 28. RLS Policy Verification

Verify RLS behavior.

### Properties

* guest cannot insert property
* owner can insert own property
* broker can insert own property
* builder cannot insert property
* user can read own property
* user can update own draft/property
* wrong user cannot update
* user cannot self-approve
* public cannot read private table
* public can read only public-safe view if approved/published

### Projects

* guest cannot insert project
* builder can insert own project
* owner cannot insert project
* broker cannot insert project
* builder can update own project
* wrong builder/user cannot update
* public cannot read private table
* public can read only public-safe view if approved/published

### Requirements

* guest cannot insert requirement
* owner can insert own requirement
* broker can insert own requirement
* builder cannot insert unless explicitly allowed later
* user can update own requirement
* wrong user cannot update
* public cannot read private contact/private fields
* public/scoped view safe only

If any wrong-role/wrong-user access passes:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 29. RLS SQL Test Suggestions

If Supabase SQL test environment is available, run equivalent tests.

Suggested scenarios:

```txt id="rls-test-scenarios"
1. Anonymous insert property → denied.
2. Owner insert property → allowed.
3. Broker insert property → allowed.
4. Builder insert property → denied.
5. Owner insert project → denied.
6. Broker insert project → denied.
7. Builder insert project → allowed.
8. Anonymous insert requirement → denied.
9. Owner insert requirement → allowed.
10. Broker insert requirement → allowed.
11. Builder insert requirement → denied unless documented future behavior.
12. User A update User B property → denied.
13. User A update User B project → denied.
14. User A update User B requirement → denied.
15. Public select private properties table → denied.
16. Public select public_properties_view → only published safe rows.
17. Public select draft/pending rows via view → no rows.
18. Public-safe view excludes contact phone/email.
```

Record exact results.

Do not mark RLS PASS without tests.

---

## 30. Direct URL Bypass Verification

Manually test or inspect direct URLs.

Examples:

```txt id="direct-url-checks"
/dashboard/properties/new
/dashboard/projects/new
/dashboard/requirements/new
/dashboard/owner/properties/new
/dashboard/broker/properties/new
/dashboard/builder/projects/new
/dashboard/properties/[id]/edit
/dashboard/projects/[id]/edit
/dashboard/requirements/[id]/edit
```

Expected:

* guest denied
* wrong role denied
* wrong owner denied
* private data not rendered before redirect
* safe unauthorized state
* no client-only protection

If direct URL bypass allows forbidden action:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 31. Hidden Contact Verification

Check entity fields, views, UI and payloads.

Hidden contact must not appear in:

* public-safe views
* public placeholder pages
* search placeholder
* cards/lists
* metadata/schema
* logs
* status events
* admin notes shown publicly
* public API response
* media metadata
* slug
* title automatically generated from phone/email

If phone/email can be put in description/title and product disallows it, validation/moderation should flag or document pending.

If hidden contact leaks directly from private fields:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 32. Fake Data Verification

Search and inspect for fake production data.

Not allowed as real:

* fake property cards
* fake project cards
* fake requirements

* fake leads
* fake inquiries
* fake approval
* fake verified badge
* fake RERA
* fake media upload
* fake images as real listings
* fake public counts
* fake analytics

If placeholder/demo data exists:

* must be clearly dev-only or labeled
* must not be treated as production real
* must not be used to mark PASS

If fake data appears real:

* create bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 33. Media Placeholder Verification

Since full media storage is later, verify:

* media upload is disabled/setup-required if storage not ready
* no fake upload success
* no fake R2/CDN URL
* no fake brochure link
* no fake video upload
* project one-video max rule documented/enforced if video metadata exists
* private media not public
* media status setup-required documented
* `API_PROVIDER_STATUS.md` marks R2/CDN appropriately

If fake media upload exists:

* create bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 34. Location Foundation Verification

Verify location fields:

* country/state/district/taluka/city/village/area/locality foundation exists or documented
* basic location required fields validated
* selected city/locality saved safely if implemented
* no fake map
* no fake nearby
* no fake IP location
* maps provider not loaded
* missing location system marked `PARTIAL`/`SETUP_REQUIRED`

If form requires impossible/unavailable location data:

* create bug
* mark `PARTIAL` or `FAIL`

---

* mark `FAIL`

---

## 36. Subscription/Billing Gate Placeholder Verification

Posting plan gate may be placeholder until billing phase.

Verify:

* no fake payment success
* no Razorpay script loaded unless billing implemented
* posting gate status documented
* if posting allowed before billing phase, docs clearly state temporary foundation behavior
* if posting blocked due to subscription setup-required, UI explains safely

If fake subscription/payment gate exists:

* create bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 37. Audit / Status Event Verification

If audit/status events implemented, verify events for:

* create
* update
* submit
* pause
* resume
* soft delete
* status transition

Verify events do not store:

* hidden contact
* secrets
* OTP
* raw provider errors
* private docs
* full private address if not needed

If audit is not implemented, ensure status is documented `PARTIAL`/`NOT_STARTED`.

---

## 38. Error Handling Verification

* forbidden
* validation error
* entity not found
* invalid status transition
* approval required

* media provider setup required
* location data setup required
* subscription gate setup required

Errors must not expose:

1024px
1366px
```

Check:

* no horizontal scroll
* form fields stack
* labels readable
* validation errors readable
* dropdowns not clipped
* buttons tappable
* stepper usable
* sticky buttons not covering content
* tables become cards
* status badges readable
* destructive actions separated
* modal/bottom sheet fits
* mobile keyboard does not hide submit area badly

If not all widths tested, mark responsive verification `PARTIAL`.

Do not mark responsive PASS without real checks.

---

pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

If scripts missing:

* record `NOT_CONFIGURED`

If checks fail:

* fix safe issues if in scope
* create bug if unresolved
* mark `FAIL` or `PARTIAL`

Build failure blocks PASS.

## 45. Public Search/Detail Deferral Check

Since full public search/detail comes next, verify:

* `/search` still safe
* public detail pages not fake
* public views ready for Prompt 05

## 56. Verification Result Decision

Use these rules.

### PASS

Mark `PASS` only if:

* build passes
* migrations exist for DB changes
* RLS enabled and tested for private tables
* property role gates pass
* project role gates pass
* requirement role gates pass
* guest denied creation
* wrong user denied editing
* public-safe views exclude private data
* draft/submitted/pending/rejected rows not public
* hidden contact does not leak
* forms validate server-side
* status transitions safe
* fake data absent
* fake approval absent
* fake media upload absent
* fake RERA absent
* responsive checks completed
* docs updated
* no blocking bugs

### PARTIAL

Use `PARTIAL` if:

* media/location/billing providers are setup-required but safely disabled
* dynamic fields foundation exists but some rare types deferred
* unit inventory foundation partial
* audit/status events partial
* RLS migration written but runtime DB tests unavailable
* responsive checks incomplete
* tests not configured but build passes
* admin moderation UI deferred properly
* public search/detail deferred to Prompt 05

Prompt 05 can start only if user/Super Admin accepts partial and no critical security leak exists.

### FAIL

Use `FAIL` if:

* build fails
* DB changes have no migration
* RLS missing on private tables
* guest can create entity
* builder can create property
* owner/broker can create project
* wrong user can edit/delete
* public can see draft/private rows
* hidden contact leaks
* fake data appears as real
* fake approval/RERA/upload exists
* service role/provider secret exposed

Do not start Prompt 05.

### BLOCKED

Use `BLOCKED` if:

* Prompt 02 auth/RLS foundation failed
* Supabase/DB unavailable and implementation cannot be verified at all
* cannot inspect required files
* package/build baseline broken
* architecture conflict needs owner decision
* missing required Prompt 04 files

### SETUP_REQUIRED

Use `SETUP_REQUIRED` for:

* Supabase env missing
* migration apply environment missing
* media storage/R2 missing
* location data/maps missing
* billing/provider gate missing
* notification provider missing

Setup-required can coexist with `PARTIAL`.

---

## 57. Prompt 05 Readiness Checklist

Prompt 05 can start only if:

* Prompt 04 implementation completed
* Prompt 04 verification completed
* no critical role/RLS/security bug open
* no public draft/private leak
* no hidden contact leak
* no fake data shown as real
* public-safe views exist or safe foundation exists
* status workflows are safe
* docs updated
* `brain.md` updated
* next prompt file exists:

  * `prompts/05_PUBLIC_SEARCH_DETAIL_PROFILE_SEO.md`

If Prompt 05 file is missing, stop and ask/generate it.

## 60. If Verification Fails

If verification fails:

1. do not start Prompt 05
2. create/update bug entries
3. update `MANUAL_VERIFICATION.md`
4. update `SECURITY_RLS_CHECKLIST.md`
5. update `PERFORMANCE_CHECKLIST.md`
6. update `DEPLOYMENT_ROLLBACK.md`
7. update `brain.md`
8. state exact blocker
9. fix if safe and in scope
10. rerun verification
11. only then proceed

Critical failures block progress.

---

## 61. If Verification Is Partial

If verification is partial:

* document exact partial items
* list setup-required providers
* list untested RLS checks
* list deferred dynamic fields
* list deferred media/location/admin moderation items
* confirm no critical role/RLS/contact leak exists
* update docs
* ask/require owner acceptance before Prompt 05 if risk is significant

Acceptable partial examples:

* media upload setup-required
* location hierarchy partial
* project unit inventory partial
* audit events partial
* admin moderation UI deferred
* full public search/detail deferred
* RLS runtime tests unavailable but policies/migration present

Not acceptable partial without fix:

* guest creation allowed
* wrong role creation allowed
* wrong user edit allowed
* public draft leak
* hidden contact leak
* fake data as real
* DB change without migration
* build fail

---

## 62. If Verification Passes

If verification passes:

* update `MANUAL_VERIFICATION.md` with PASS
* update `FEATURE_REGISTRY.md`
* update `CHANGELOG.md`
* update `SECURITY_RLS_CHECKLIST.md`
* update `PERFORMANCE_CHECKLIST.md`
* update `DEPLOYMENT_ROLLBACK.md`
* update `brain.md`
* final response should say Prompt 05 can start

Do not start Prompt 05 automatically unless user asked to continue.

---

## 63. What Not To Do In This Verification

Do not:

* implement full public search/detail SEO
* implement full leads/inquiries
* implement payment
* implement media storage
* implement full admin moderation
* add fake listings for testing
* add fake projects
* add fake requirements
* add fake approval
* add fake RERA
* bypass RLS to test
* disable RLS
* loosen role gates without approval
* expose service role
* print secrets
* ignore direct URL bypass
* ignore hidden contact leak
* mark PASS without RLS/security checks
* start Prompt 05 after FAIL/BLOCKED

---

## 64. Quality Bar

This verification is successful when future phases can trust that:

* properties are role-gated and secure
* projects are builder-only
* requirements are owner/broker-only
* guests cannot create entities
* wrong users cannot edit entities
* statuses support approval workflow
* public-safe views expose only safe approved data
* draft/pending/private data is protected
* hidden contact is protected
* RLS is enabled and tested or honestly setup-required
* forms validate server-side
* no fake data/approval/RERA/media exists
* docs accurately reflect implementation
* Prompt 05 can safely build public search/detail/profile/SEO on top
