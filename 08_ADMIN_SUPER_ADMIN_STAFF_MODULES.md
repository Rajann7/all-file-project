# My Gujarat Property — Admin, Super Admin, Staff Modules, Permissions And Operations System

This document defines the complete **Super Admin, Admin and Staff operations system** for **My Gujarat Property**.

Claude must read this file before implementing admin login, staff login, Super Admin dashboard, admin/staff dashboards, staff permissions, moderation queues, user management, verification review, reports, support tickets, billing admin, payment admin, ads approval, provider settings, feature flags, CMS/legal/SEO admin, locations admin, audit logs, system health, security operations or admin RLS policies.

No public admin registration is allowed.

No staff permission bypass is allowed.

No sensitive provider secret leak is allowed.

No admin action can fake approval/payment/verification/provider status.

No normal staff can access modules without permission.

## 2. Core Internal Admin Principles

The internal admin system must follow these principles:

1. Admin/staff login is separate from public login.
2. Public users cannot create admin/staff accounts.
3. Staff accounts are invite-only.
4. Admin/staff routes must be noindex.
5. Admin/staff routes must not be in sitemap.
6. Staff permissions must be granular.
7. Staff UI hiding is not enough.
8. Server actions/API routes must enforce permissions.
9. RLS or secure backend checks must protect internal data.
10. Sensitive actions must be audited.
11. High-risk actions need confirmation.
12. High-risk actions may require maker-checker.
13. Provider secrets must never be shown raw.
14. Payment actions must not bypass verified webhook rules.
15. Verification badges must be real.
16. RERA badges must be real.
17. Ads must not show unless approved/paid/active/not expired.
18. Private documents require explicit permission.
19. Exports require explicit permission.
20. Bulk actions require explicit permission.
21. Staff cannot bypass permissions through direct URL.
22. Admin tables must be paginated.
23. Admin UI must be mobile usable.
24. No fake operational status is allowed.
25. No critical admin action can be undocumented.

## 3. Internal User Types

Internal user types:

| Internal User   | Meaning                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Super Admin     | highest platform owner/operator access      |
| Admin           | operational admin with assigned permissions |
| Staff           | scoped internal team member                 |
| Disabled Staff  | internal account disabled; no access        |
| Suspended Staff | internal account temporarily blocked        |
| Invited Staff   | invited but not accepted                    |
| Audit Reviewer  | staff/admin with audit permissions          |
| System Operator | staff/admin with safe system health access  |

Public marketplace roles are not internal roles.

Public roles:

* Owner
* Broker/Agent
* Builder/Developer

Public roles must not access internal admin panel.

---

## 4. Internal Login Rules

Admin/staff login must be separate.

Recommended route:

```txt id="admin-login-route"
/admin/login
```

Allowed login methods:

* email/password where configured
* Google login where configured
* magic link where configured and secure
* 2FA where implemented/setup-required

Not allowed:

* public mobile OTP login
* public registration
* public “create admin account”
* public role selector with admin/staff
* hidden admin creation through query param
* client-side role override

Admin/staff login must include:

* safe errors
* rate limiting
* session timeout
* noindex
* robots disallow
* suspicious login event tracking where implemented
* disabled/suspended account block
* audit/security event log
* separate internal dashboard redirect

---

## 5. Staff Invite-Only System

Staff creation flow:

1. Super Admin/Admin with permission creates invite.
2. Invite includes email, role and permission set.
3. Invite token generated securely.
4. Invite token stored hashed.
5. Invite expiry set.
6. Email sent if email provider configured.
7. If email provider missing, invite marked setup-required/manual.
8. Staff accepts invite.
9. Internal account created/linked.
10. Staff profile created.
11. Permissions assigned.
12. Invite marked accepted.
13. Audit log written.

Rules:

* invite token one-time use
* invite token hashed
* expired invite denied
* accepted invite cannot be reused
* staff cannot self-register
* public user cannot accept staff invite unless internal account flow validates email/invite
* staff role/permission assignment audited
* disabled staff cannot login
* invite resend audited

---

## 6. Super Admin Scope

Super Admin has full platform control.

Super Admin can manage:

* staff accounts
* staff permissions
* admins
* users
* roles
* properties
* projects
* requirements
* leads/CRM oversight
* verification
* reports/fraud
* support
* billing
* payments
* refunds/credit notes where implemented
* plans
* trials
* coupons
* invoices
* GST settings
* ads/promotions
* notifications
* provider settings
* provider status
* feature flags
* system settings
* maintenance mode
* CMS pages
* legal pages
* blog
* SEO
* redirects
* location hierarchy
* missing location requests
* audit logs
* security events
* exports
* reports
* system health
* deployment/rollback signoff

Super Admin must still follow:

* audit rules
* safe confirmation
* backup/rollback rules
* payment verification rules
* no secret leak rules
* no direct DB destructive action without approval/backup
* no fake provider/payment/verification status

---

## 7. Admin Scope

Admin is an internal operator with assigned permissions.

Admin may manage:

* users
* moderation queues
* verification
* support
* reports
* billing
* payments
* ads
* content
* SEO
* locations
* notifications
* provider status read-only
* system health read-only

Admin cannot by default:

* create Super Admin
* manage provider secrets
* manage feature flags
* change staff permissions
* change core security settings
* disable RLS
* hard delete sensitive data
* process refunds without permission
* manually activate payments without permission/audit
* access private docs without permission
* export sensitive data without permission
* override maker-checker where required

Admin permissions must be explicit.

---

## 8. Staff Role Types

Staff roles supported:

* Verification Manager
* Support Manager
* Content Manager
* SEO Manager
* Ads Manager
* Billing Manager
* Payment Manager
* City Manager
* User Manager
* Notification Manager
* System Manager
* Security Manager
* Reports Manager
* Audit Manager

Each staff role must have module-scoped permissions.

Staff role name alone is not enough.

Permission flags must decide actual access.
