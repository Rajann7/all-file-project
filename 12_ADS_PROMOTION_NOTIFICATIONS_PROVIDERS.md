---

## 59. SQL Migration Rule

If DB changes are needed, create migration:

* no fake delivery logs.
* no public access.

---

## 70. Provider Setup Required UX

When provider missing:

* show setup-required status
* disable external delivery
* still allow in-app notification if DB-ready
* do not show fake sent status
* do not block core user action unnecessarily if notification can be queued/skipped
* update API_PROVIDER_STATUS
* update docs

Examples:

* Email missing → notification delivery email setup-required, in-app still created.
* WhatsApp missing → no WhatsApp sent, no fake wa.me API delivery.
* SMS missing → no SMS sent.
* Push missing → push disabled/setup-required.
* Cron missing → digest/retry setup-required.

---

## 71. In-App Notifications Versus External Delivery

In-app notifications:

* DB-backed
* recipient private
* can be created if notification tables/RLS ready
* unread count real
* no provider required

External delivery:

* email/SMS/WhatsApp/push
* requires provider configured
* requires user preference/consent
* requires template
* requires delivery log
* status real only
* setup-required if not configured

Do not confuse in-app notification with provider delivery.

---

## 72. Notification Source Integration

Integrate notification event creation with existing phases where safe:

* Prompt 04 moderation statuses
* Prompt 08 leads/messages/proposals/site visits
* Prompt 09 payments/invoices/subscriptions
* Prompt 10 media processing failures
* Prompt 12 ad statuses
* Prompt 07 admin assignments/provider alerts

Rules:

* do not break existing flows.
* if integration partial, document exact event types done.
* no fake events.
* no duplicate spam.
* idempotency/dedup where possible.

---

## 73. Idempotency Requirements

Idempotency required for:

* ad impression events
* ad click events
* notification event creation
* external notification delivery
* provider webhook callbacks
* retry attempts
* ad status transitions
* provider status checks

Rules:

* duplicate event does not duplicate notification spam.
* duplicate provider callback does not change status incorrectly.
* duplicate click/impression filtered or counted according to rules.
* idempotency key stored where needed.

---

## 74. Rate Limit Requirements

Add or prepare rate limits for:

* ad campaign creation
* creative upload session creation
* ad impression/click tracking
* notification delivery queueing
* provider test sends
* provider webhook processing
* support/provider admin actions
* mark-read spam if needed

Rules:

* no unbounded event writes.
* provider test send limited.
* click/impression endpoint abuse controlled.
* rate limit status documented.
* no fake rate limit claim.

---

## 75. Security / Privacy Deep Requirements

Must protect:

* ad campaign private data
* targeting internals
* payment/ad credit data
* notification payloads
* provider configs
* provider logs
* provider secrets
* webhook payloads
* DLQ records
* hidden contact
* user preferences
* admin notes
* IP/user agent data

Must not:

* expose provider secrets
* expose hidden contact in notification/ad payloads
* expose private campaign data publicly
* expose private notification to wrong user
* expose raw IP publicly
* allow open redirect in ad clicks/deep links
* allow fake provider active status
* allow public pending/rejected ads

---

## 76. Public SEO Boundary

Ads/notification/provider private pages should not be indexed.

Noindex/no-store:

* builder ads dashboard
* ad campaign detail/manage
* admin ads
* admin providers
* notification center
* notification preferences
* provider logs
* provider webhooks
* provider setup pages

Public ad creatives may appear on public pages but:

* should not create separate indexable private ad pages.
* should not be in sitemap unless public creative is part of public page.
* must not expose campaign private metadata.

---

## 77. Public Search / SEO Ad Boundary

If ads appear in search:

* label Sponsored
* do not alter organic canonical/metadata with ad private data
* do not include ad click tracker URLs in sitemap
* do not fake organic ranking
* do not include pending/rejected ads
* no private targeting data in source
* no hidden contact

If search ad placement is not ready, keep it setup-required.

---

## 78. API Provider Status Updates

Update `API_PROVIDER_STATUS.md` for:

* Email provider
* SMS provider
* WhatsApp provider
* Push provider
* OTP provider status reference
* Razorpay/payment status reference
* Google Maps/geocoding
* Cloudflare R2/CDN reference
* Turnstile/Captcha
* Analytics/GSC
* Error monitoring
* Cron/retry jobs
* Supabase Database/RLS

Statuses must be accurate:

```txt id="provider-status-values"
NOT_STARTED
SETUP_REQUIRED
CONFIGURED
TEST_MODE
ACTIVE
PARTIAL
DEGRADED
FAILED
BLOCKED
```

Do not mark active without real test.

---

## 79. Feature Registry Updates

Update `FEATURE_REGISTRY.md` for:

* builder ad dashboard

## 94. Quality Bar

This phase is successful when future phases can rely on:

* ads are builder/project-scoped
* ads require published project
* RERA/payment/approval gates are safe and honest
* public ads show Sponsored label
* public ads never show private/pending/rejected campaigns
* metrics are real or no-data
* notifications are DB-backed and recipient-scoped
* unread count is real
* notification preferences are private
* external providers show honest setup-required/test/active states
* provider secrets are protected
* provider delivery logs/retries are honest
* no fake ads/notifications/provider delivery exists
* RLS protects private tables
* docs reflect reality
* manual verification is ready
