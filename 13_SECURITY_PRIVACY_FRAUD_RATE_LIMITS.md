---

## 8. Security Inventory Required

Create or update a security inventory in `SECURITY_RLS_CHECKLIST.md`.

Inventory must include:

admin
staff
api_public
api_authenticated
api_admin
api_webhook

For each route group, verify:

* access level
* auth requirement
* role requirement
* permission requirement
* noindex/no-store need
* rate limit need
* RLS dependency
* sensitive output risk

Do not leave private route unclassified.

---

* never be imported into browser code.
* never be exposed in API response.
* only be used in trusted server-only code.
* be isolated in clearly named server-only module.
* not be used to bypass RLS unless necessary and documented.
* require explicit permission checks before privileged operations.
* be absent from edge/client bundles if unsafe.

Search and fix any unsafe service role usage.

---

## 24. Input Validation Hardening

* validate IDs exist and belong to user.
* validate enum values.
* validate numeric ranges.
* validate URLs.
* validate dates.
* avoid trusting client role/status.

---

## 25. Output Sanitization / XSS Prevention

Harden output rendering.

Risk areas:

* CMS/blog/legal body
* user notes
* messages
* ad titles/creative captions
* property/project titles/descriptions
* location names
* support/grievance text
* notification templates
* admin notes
* profile descriptions
* rich text fields

Rules:

* escape by default.
* sanitize rich HTML server-side.
* avoid unsafe `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
* if used, require sanitizer and safe allowlist.
* block script/event handlers.
* block unsafe iframes.
* block javascript/data URLs.
* avoid rendering raw provider/webhook payload.

---

## 26. CSRF Protection Foundation

For state-changing actions:

* server actions/auth checks required.
* API mutations require auth and method checks.
* same-site cookies configured.
* CSRF token or framework equivalent documented for high-risk APIs.
* admin/provider/payment actions protected.
* webhook endpoints excluded from CSRF but signature/idempotency protected.
* public forms rate-limited and validated.

If CSRF protection relies on framework defaults, document exact behavior.

---

## 27. CORS Requirements

CORS should be strict.

Rules:

* no wildcard CORS for authenticated/private APIs.
* public APIs only allow needed methods.
* credentials not allowed for untrusted origins.
* provider webhooks do not rely on CORS for security.
* admin/provider APIs not callable cross-origin with credentials.
* local dev config separated from production.

If CORS is broad due to provider needs, document and restrict by route.

---

## 28. Security Headers Requirements

Add or verify security headers:

```txt id="security-headers"
Content-Security-Policy
X-Frame-Options or frame-ancestors
X-Content-Type-Options
Referrer-Policy
Permissions-Policy
Strict-Transport-Security
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy
Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy where safe
```

Rules:

* CSP should be compatible with Next.js and providers.
* start with report-only if strict CSP may break app.
* do not allow unsafe-inline broadly without reason.
* iframe providers allowlisted only for approved embeds.
* uploads/media domains allowlisted.
* payment provider scripts allowlisted only where needed.
* admin pages protected against framing.

---

## 29. CSP Foundation

CSP should consider:

* own domain
* Supabase
* Cloudflare R2/CDN
* Razorpay checkout
* Maps provider if configured
* image/media CDN
* analytics if configured
* safe iframe providers
* no arbitrary script domains
* no user-provided script
* no unsafe iframe

If strict CSP not fully implemented:

* add documented foundation
* mark `CSP_PARTIAL`
* do not claim full CSP PASS

---

## 30. SSRF Prevention

Risk areas:

* virtual tour URL
* external image URL if allowed
* CMS embeds
* webhook callbacks
* provider test URLs
* redirect destination checks
* map/geocode APIs

Rules:

* do not fetch arbitrary user-provided URLs server-side.
* allowlist providers.
* block localhost/private IP ranges if server fetch exists.

---

## 83. Phase Completion Status Rules

### `DONE`

Use when implementation completed but manual verification pending.

### `PASS`

Do not use from implementation prompt alone unless manual verification also completed and documented.

### `PARTIAL`

Use if:

* CSP report-only/foundation only
* durable rate limit store setup-required
* fraud detection foundation partial
* captcha/WAF setup-required
* malware scan setup-required
* backup restore test setup-required
* incident response docs foundation only
* RLS runtime tests pending
* provider webhook testing pending
* penetration test external audit pending
* responsive/browser/security checks pending

### `FAIL`

Use if:

* build fails
* service role in client
* provider secret exposed
* hidden contact leak
* public admin access
* direct URL bypass leaks private data
* wrong-user private data access
* RLS missing on private table
* private media/doc public
* payment webhook bypass
* unsafe provider webhook mutates data
* unsafe CMS HTML executes
* open redirect exists
* raw secrets in logs
* DB changes missing migration

### `BLOCKED`

Use if:

* previous phase verification failed and security depends on it
* Supabase/RLS unavailable blocks final pass
* architecture conflict requires owner decision
* provider secret management unresolved
* rate limit store unavailable and required for production decision
* package/build baseline broken
* cannot inspect required files

### `SETUP_REQUIRED`

Use for:

* durable rate limit store missing
* captcha/WAF provider missing
* malware scanner missing
* error monitoring missing
* backup provider/setup missing
* cron cleanup/retention jobs missing
* CSP reporting endpoint missing
* external security audit missing
* production env/security headers not deployed
* Supabase env missing

Setup-required is acceptable only when no active critical leak/bypass remains.

## 87. Quality Bar

This phase is successful when future phases can rely on:

* route guards are server-side
* role boundaries are enforced
* admin is private and separate
* direct URL bypasses are blocked
* RLS protects private data
* hidden contact is protected everywhere
* private documents/media remain private
* provider secrets are server-only
* service role is server-only
* inputs are validated
* rich content is sanitized
* security headers/CSP foundation exists
* webhooks are signature/idempotency hardened where applicable
* critical actions have rate-limit foundation
* spam/scraping/fraud foundations exist
* logs redact sensitive data
* audit logs cover high-risk actions
* retention/incident/backup docs are updated
* no fake security status exists
* manual verification is ready
