## 2. Core Billing Principles

Billing must follow these principles:

1. Plans must be role-specific.
2. Active plan may be required before posting property/project/requirement.
3. Plan limits must be enforced server-side.
4. Client-side plan UI is not enough.
5. Payment amount must be calculated server-side.
6. Client amount must never be trusted.
7. Payment provider must be real or setup-required.
8. Payment success must be verified server-side.
9. Razorpay webhook signature verification is mandatory.
10. Client checkout success callback alone cannot activate plan.
11. Failed payment cannot activate plan.
12. Pending payment cannot activate plan.
13. Invoice must be generated only after verified successful payment.
14. Sequential invoice number must not be wasted on failed payment.
15. Manual activation must be permission-gated and audited.
16. Refunds and credit notes must be permission-gated and audited.
17. GST rules must be clear.
18. Trial rules must be clear.
19. Free trial must not auto-charge unless explicitly disclosed and implemented legally.
20. No fake subscription, payment, invoice, GST or plan status is allowed.

## 54.12 `usage_counters`

Fields:

* `usage_key`
* `used_count`
* `limit_count`
* `period_start`
* `period_end`
* `updated_at`

---

## 55. Index Expectations

Indexes required for:

* plans by role/status
* subscriptions by profile/status
* subscriptions by expiry/grace
* payments by profile/status
* payments by provider_order_id
* payments by provider_payment_id
* webhook events by provider_event_id unique
* invoices by profile
* invoices by invoice_number unique
* invoice sequences by financial_year unique
* coupons by code unique
* coupon redemptions by coupon/profile/payment
* refunds by payment/status
* billing profiles by profile
* usage counters by profile/subscription/key
* admin payment filters by date/status/provider
* admin subscription filters by role/status/expiry

---

## 56. Migration Expectations

Billing implementation requires SQL migrations for:

* plans
* subscriptions
* payments
* webhook events
* invoices
* invoice sequences
* billing profiles
* coupons
* coupon redemptions
* trials
* add-ons
* refunds
* credit notes
* usage counters
* RLS policies
* indexes
* audit logs
* public pricing views

Migration must include:

* header
* purpose
* phase
* tables changed
* RLS changed yes/no
* destructive changes yes/no
* backup required yes/no
* rollback notes

No DB change without migration.

---

## 57. Payment Webhook Route Requirements

Webhook route must:

* use raw body
* verify signature
* reject invalid signature
* store event
* process idempotently
* update payment
* update subscription/add-on/ad
* generate invoice
* enqueue notification
* return appropriate status
* not expose sensitive errors

Webhook route must use Node runtime if raw body/crypto/provider SDK requires it.

Do not run webhook on unsupported Edge runtime if it breaks signature verification.

---

## 58. Caching Rules

Do not publicly cache:

* billing dashboard
* checkout
* payment records
* invoices
* payment admin
* subscription admin
* refund data
* webhook event data
* billing profile
* coupon redemption
* user-specific plan usage

Public pricing page may be cached if public-safe.

Revalidate pricing after plan changes.

Revalidate user billing after payment/subscription changes.

---

## 59. Performance Rules

Billing performance requirements:

* payment admin tables paginated
* invoice list paginated
* subscription list paginated
* webhook processing fast
* heavy invoice PDF generation async if needed
* provider calls timeout-safe
* no unbounded payment queries
* indexed provider IDs
* indexed invoice numbers
* indexed subscription expiry jobs
* coupon validation efficient
* no slow provider call blocking public pages

---

## 60. Provider Status Rules

Billing depends on providers:

| Provider          | Usage                           | Status Before Config |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Razorpay          | payments                        | `SETUP_REQUIRED`     |
| Email provider    | invoice/receipt email           | `SETUP_REQUIRED`     |
| SMS provider      | billing alerts if used          | `SETUP_REQUIRED`     |
| WhatsApp provider | billing alerts if used          | `SETUP_REQUIRED`     |
| PDF provider      | invoice PDF if external         | `SETUP_REQUIRED`     |
| Storage provider  | invoice PDF storage             | `SETUP_REQUIRED`     |
| Cron/job provider | expiry/reminders/reconciliation | `SETUP_REQUIRED`     |

If provider missing, UI must show setup-required or fallback.

No fake provider success.

## 61. Manual Verification Checklist

Manual verification must check:

### Plans

* owner plans visible correctly
* broker plans visible correctly
* builder plans visible correctly
* wrong role cannot buy wrong plan
* inactive plan not purchasable
* plan limits displayed honestly
* no fake popular/discount claims

### Posting Gates

* owner without plan blocked if required
* broker without plan blocked if required

* direct URL/API cannot bypass gate
* server-side enforcement works

### Coupons

* valid coupon applies
* expired coupon rejected
* wrong role coupon rejected
* usage limit enforced
* client cannot manipulate discount

### Payment

* Razorpay setup-required if missing
* order created server-side
* client amount not trusted
* cancelled payment stays inactive
* failed payment stays inactive
* pending payment stays pending
* webhook success activates subscription
* invalid webhook signature rejected
