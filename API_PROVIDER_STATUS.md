# My Gujarat Property — API Provider Status, Setup, Verification And Fallback Rules

This file tracks every external provider, API mode, setup state, verification result, production readiness status, fallback behavior and provider-related risk for **My Gujarat Property**.

Claude must update this file whenever any provider/API/env/config/payment/storage/communication/map/analytics/monitoring/cron status changes.

No fake provider success is allowed.

If a provider is not configured, the feature must show `SETUP_REQUIRED`, `BLOCKED`, `DISABLED_BY_FLAG` or safe fallback.

---

## 1. Purpose

This file tracks:

* Supabase Auth
* Supabase PostgreSQL
* Supabase RLS
* Supabase Server Client
* Supabase Storage if used
* OTP provider
* SMS provider
* Email provider
* WhatsApp free mode
* WhatsApp Business Cloud API
* Razorpay payment provider
* Razorpay webhooks
* Google Maps Embed mode
* Google Maps API / Places mode
* Cloudflare R2 storage
* Cloudflare CDN
* Cloudflare Turnstile
* Analytics provider
* Error tracking provider
* Monitoring provider
* Cron/background job provider
* Image/video/PDF processing provider or queue
* Malware/file scan provider if used
* PDF generation provider/library
* Email invoice delivery provider
* Push notification provider if enabled
* GeoIP/city detection provider if enabled
* Search Console/SEO provider if enabled

This file ensures provider-backed features are never marked complete unless the real provider state is known, tested and documented.

---

## 2. Mandatory Provider Rule

Every provider-backed feature must have one of these:

1. real working provider configuration
2. setup-required state
3. disabled feature flag
4. documented fallback mode
5. blocked status with exact reason

Never show:

* fake OTP sent
* fake SMS sent
* fake WhatsApp sent
* fake email sent
* fake payment success
* fake invoice sent
* fake upload success
* fake CDN active state
* fake map loaded state
* fake analytics count
* fake provider health active
* fake notification delivered
* fake webhook verified
* fake verified badge
* fake RERA/provider status
* fake active plan due to failed payment

## 6. Provider Environment Safety Rules

Claude must follow these rules for all provider configuration:

1. Never hardcode secrets.
2. Never paste real secrets in docs.
3. Never expose service role keys.
4. Never expose provider API secrets in client code.
5. Never expose `.env` values in chat, docs, logs or screenshots.
6. Update `.env.example` whenever any environment variable is added, changed or removed.
7. `.env.example` must show variable names only, not real values.
8. Client-exposed public keys must be clearly named and intentionally safe.
9. Server-only secrets must be used only in trusted server-side code.
10. Provider test mode must not be active in production.
11. Dev/mock providers must not be active in production.
12. Production should fail safe if required provider secrets are missing.
13. Missing provider should show `SETUP_REQUIRED` or safe fallback, not fake success.
14. Logs must not include API keys, tokens, OTPs, payment secrets, webhook payload secrets, private URLs or full request payloads.
15. Provider webhook signatures must be verified where supported.
16. Provider retries must be idempotent.
17. Provider failures must not crash the website.
18. Provider failures must not expose raw errors to users.
19. Provider changes must be audit logged.
20. Provider settings must be Super Admin controlled where applicable.

### Required Environment Variables

| Variable                        | Client/Server      | Required    | Status        | Notes                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`      | Client-safe public | Yes         | `NOT_STARTED` | Public project URL only               |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Client-safe public | Yes         | `NOT_STARTED` | Public anon key; must rely on RLS     |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`     | Server-only        | Conditional | `NOT_STARTED` | Never expose to browser/client        |
| `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`           | Server-only        | Conditional | `NOT_STARTED` | Only if backend verification needs it |

### Public/Private Data Rules

* Sends user personal data: Yes
* Sends phone number: Yes for OTP/auth
* Sends email: Yes for email/admin auth
* Sends property/project data: No direct requirement except profile/session usage
* Sends payment data: No
* Sends document/media data: No
* Sensitive data handling: Auth data must be protected by RLS and server-side authorization.

### Setup Steps

1. Create/configure Supabase project.
2. Configure auth providers.
3. Configure OTP/email settings.
4. Configure public environment variables.
5. Keep service role server-only.
6. Configure callback URLs.
7. Configure admin/staff separate login rules in app.
8. Test public auth and admin/staff auth separately.

### Verification Checklist

| Check                                     | Result    | Notes                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------- |
| Public mobile OTP auth configured         | `NOT_RUN` | Provider setup pending          |
| Register role selector works with Auth    | `NOT_RUN` | Implementation pending          |
| Logged-in session persists                | `NOT_RUN` | Implementation pending          |
| Logout works                              | `NOT_RUN` | Implementation pending          |
| Admin/staff public login blocked          | `NOT_RUN` | Implementation pending          |
| Staff/admin email/Google login configured | `NOT_RUN` | Provider setup pending          |
| Service role not exposed                  | `NOT_RUN` | Security implementation pending |
| Auth errors safe                          | `NOT_RUN` | Implementation pending          |

### Failure Behavior

* User-facing fallback: show auth unavailable or setup-required if OTP provider missing.
* Admin-facing error: show provider status without exposing secrets.
* Retry behavior: safe retry with rate limits.
* Notification behavior: suspicious auth notifications only if notification provider configured; otherwise in-app/setup-required.
* Feature state if failed: login/register blocked or degraded with clear safe message.

### Security Requirements

* Secret handling: service role server-only.
* Webhook signature: not applicable unless auth webhooks are used.
* Rate limit: login/OTP attempts must be rate-limited.
* Audit log: staff/admin login and suspicious auth events tracked.
* Log redaction: no OTP/token/session/private payload in logs.
* Server/client boundary: server-only auth admin operations never imported in client.

### Production Readiness

* Live key configured: No
* Test mode disabled: Not applicable yet
* Mock mode disabled: Not applicable yet
* Error fallback tested: No
* Cost/quota reviewed: No
* Legal/privacy reviewed: Pending
* Final status: `NOT_STARTED`

### Verification Checklist

| Check                      | Result    | Notes                   |
| -------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| DB connection works        | `NOT_RUN` | Implementation pending  |
| Migrations apply           | `NOT_RUN` | Migration files pending |
| Required tables exist      | `NOT_RUN` | DB schema pending       |
| Indexes exist where needed | `NOT_RUN` | Pending                 |

### Failure Behavior

* User-facing fallback: show contact unavailable or copy/share alternative.
* Admin-facing error: not applicable unless platform number misconfigured.
* Retry behavior: not applicable; user opens WhatsApp manually.
* Feature state if failed: fallback to call/inquiry/share link.

### Security Requirements

* Do not show hidden contact to guest.
* Do not include private data in message template.
* Track click as user-initiated, not delivered message.
* Never show “sent” for `wa.me`; only “opened WhatsApp” or click tracked.

7. Update `.env.example`.
8. Implement upload validation.
9. Implement public/private file classification.
10. Implement signed private URL access.
11. Implement upload logs.
12. Implement orphan cleanup tracking.
13. Implement lifecycle/cost alerts where possible.
14. Test public image upload.
15. Test private document upload.
16. Test signed URL expiry.
17. Test unauthorized private access denied.

## 23.2 Production Launch Blocking Provider Issues

Production launch is blocked if:

* OTP dev mode is active
* Razorpay test mode is active for live billing
* payment webhook signature verification is missing
* failed/pending payment can activate subscription
* provider secrets are exposed to client
* service role key is exposed
* private documents use public bucket
* hidden contacts leak through API/provider/logs
* fake provider health says active
* fake email/SMS/WhatsApp sent status is shown
* R2/CDN not configured but upload UI claims success
* Maps missing but UI crashes
* analytics sends private data without consent
* error tracking logs OTP/tokens/private data
* production `.env.example` is outdated
* missing provider has no setup-required/fallback state
* provider failure crashes main website

`.env.example` must include:

* variable name
* blank/example placeholder
* short comment if needed
* no real secret
* no private URL
* no real API key

RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=
RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
```

Rules:

* Do not commit real `.env`.
* Do not paste real `.env` values in docs.
* If new env variable is added and `.env.example` is not updated, phase cannot be `PASS`.

Main rule: no provider-backed feature can fake success. Missing provider must show setup-required, disabled, blocked or fallback state.
```

---

# 35. Final Rule

Provider-backed features are only complete when the provider is real, configured, tested, secure, documented and verified.

If a provider is missing, show `SETUP_REQUIRED`.

If a provider fails, show safe fallback or `FAILED`.

If provider testing is not done, mark `NEEDS_PROVIDER_CHECK`.

Never fake success.

Never expose secrets.

Never activate payments, plans, uploads, notifications, maps, OTP, analytics or provider health without real verification.
