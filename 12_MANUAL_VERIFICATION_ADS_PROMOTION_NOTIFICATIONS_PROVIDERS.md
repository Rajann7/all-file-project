# My Gujarat Property — Prompt 12 Manual Verification: Ads, Promotion, Notifications And Providers

This prompt is for Claude Code.

Use this prompt immediately after completing:

```txt id="matching-implementation-prompt"
prompts/12_ADS_PROMOTION_NOTIFICATIONS_PROVIDERS.md
```

This prompt verifies the **Ads, Promotion, Notifications And Providers** phase.

Do not skip this verification.

Do not start Prompt 13 until this verification is complete or the project owner/Super Admin explicitly accepts a documented `PARTIAL`, `BLOCKED` or `SETUP_REQUIRED` state.

Do not mark PASS without real ads, notification, provider, RLS, privacy, sponsored label, fake-data, provider-secret, responsive and docs checks.

Do not fake PASS.

## 2. Verification Purpose

The purpose of this verification phase is to confirm that ads, promotions, notifications and providers are implemented honestly, safely, privately and without fake delivery or fake metrics.

This verification checks:

* builder ad dashboard
* builder-only campaign creation
* campaign model
* ad creative model
* ad placement model
* ad targeting model
* ad scheduling
* campaign status lifecycle
* own published project eligibility
* RERA gate
* payment/ad credit gate
* creative media integration
* admin ad moderation
* ad approval workflow
* public active ad serving
* Sponsored label requirement
* city/location targeting
* nearby/IP fallback setup status
* impression event tracking
* click event tracking
* ad metrics foundation
* fraud filtering foundation
* frequency cap foundation
* notification events
* notification records
* notification center
* notification bell
* real unread count
* mark read
* mark all read
* notification preferences
* notification templates
* notification deep links
* recipient privacy
* provider registry
* provider modes
* provider setup-required states
* email provider foundation
* SMS provider foundation
* WhatsApp provider foundation
* push provider foundation
* OTP/payment/maps/media provider status references
* provider delivery logs
* retry/DLQ foundation
* provider webhook/callback foundation
* provider secret masking
* provider admin permissions
* RLS policies
* public/private table protection
* hidden contact protection
* open redirect protection
* private noindex/no-store
* responsive ads/notification/provider UI
* docs updates
* Prompt 13 readiness

This phase does not verify full production WhatsApp/SMS/email approval, final ad billing settlement, final fraud ML detection, final notification digest cron, final native push rollout, external ad network integration, or final marketing automation. Those are later or operational checks.

## 7. Migration Verification

If Prompt 12 changed database schema, verify migration exists.

Expected pattern:

```txt id="expected-migration"
supabase/migrations/*_ads_promotion_notifications_providers.sql
```

Verify migration includes:

* purpose
* phase: Prompt 12
* tables created/changed
* views created/changed
* RLS policies created/changed
* indexes created
* event idempotency constraints
* public active ads view if implemented
* provider webhook event unique constraints
* destructive changes yes/no
* backup required yes/no
* rollback notes

If DB changed without migration:

* create critical bug
* mark verification `FAIL`
* do not start Prompt 13

If migration exists without rollback notes:

* create bug
* mark `PARTIAL` or `FAIL` depending data/provider/public ad risk

If DB not changed because Supabase/env unavailable:

* mark DB/RLS runtime checks `SETUP_REQUIRED`

* approval status/events if moderation exists
* notification record table if notification UI exists
* notification recipient/read status
* provider status/config/log foundation if provider UI exists

* provider webhook processing
* manual retry/DLQ actions
* mark read spam if needed

Check:

* no unbounded event writes
* provider test send limited
* click/impression endpoint protected
* provider failure does not create infinite retry loop
* rate-limit status documented

If public impression/click endpoint can be spammed unbounded with no mitigation/foundation:

* create bug
* mark `PARTIAL` or `FAIL`

---

## 68. Provider Setup Required Verification

When provider missing, verify:

* external delivery disabled/setup-required
* in-app notification can still work if DB-ready
* no fake sent/delivered status
* user action still succeeds if notification is non-critical
* provider status updated
* admin setup guide/status shown
* no provider secret shown
* no fake provider active

Provider missing examples:

* Email missing → email delivery setup-required, no fake email sent.
* SMS missing → SMS delivery setup-required, no fake SMS sent.
* WhatsApp missing → WhatsApp setup-required, no fake WhatsApp sent.
* Push missing → push setup-required/not-started.
* Cron missing → digest/retry setup-required.
* Maps missing → IP/nearby targeting setup-required.

---

## 69. In-App Vs External Notification Verification

Verify distinction:

### In-app

* DB-backed
* recipient-scoped
* unread count real
* no external provider needed
* status sent_in_app/read based on DB

### External

* email/SMS/WhatsApp/push
* provider configured/tested
* user preference/consent respected
* delivery logs real
* setup-required if missing
* no fake delivered

If UI shows “WhatsApp sent” when only in-app notification exists:

* create bug
* mark `FAIL` or `PARTIAL`

---

## 70. Provider Webhook Security Verification

For each provider webhook/callback endpoint:

* signature verification if provider supports it
* verify token if applicable
* event ID idempotency
* event type allowlist
* safe error response
* no secret in response
* no raw stack trace
* duplicate callback safe
* unsupported event safe
* delivery status update correct
* no public data leak

If provider webhook lacks idempotency/signature where needed:

* create bug
* mark `PARTIAL` or `FAIL`

---

## 71. Public SEO Boundary Verification

Verify ads/notifications/providers private pages are excluded:

* builder ads dashboard not in sitemap
* admin ads not in sitemap
* provider pages not in sitemap
* notification center not in sitemap
* notification preferences not in sitemap
* ad click tracker not in sitemap
* provider webhooks not in sitemap
* private ad campaign details not indexed

Public ad creative can appear inside public page, but no private campaign metadata.

If private ad/provider/notification URL appears in sitemap:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 72. UI Verification — Ads

Verify ads UI:

* builder campaign list real/no-data
* create form validates required fields
* project dropdown only own published projects
* creative upload/select real/setup-required
* target location selector works/setup-required
* schedule fields validate
* submit for review works
* review feedback shown
* pause/resume/cancel safe
* metrics real/no-data
* no fake active campaign
* no dead buttons
* mobile usable

If builder UI shows fake metrics as real:

* create bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 73. UI Verification — Public Ads

Verify public ads:

* Sponsored label visible
* ad creative real/public-safe
* click target safe
* no private/pending/rejected ads
* no layout shift
* no fake placeholder paid ad
* hide empty ad slot or safe empty state
* RERA/disclaimer shown if applicable
* mobile responsive
* accessible label

If no eligible ads, there should be no fake paid ad.

---

## 74. UI Verification — Notifications

Verify notification UI:

* bell icon visible where appropriate
* real unread count
* dropdown latest real
* notification center list real
* filters work if implemented
* mark read works
* mark all read works
* preferences link works
* empty state real
* error/loading states safe
* mobile bottom sheet works
* no hidden contact
* no broken deep links

If wrong user's notification appears:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 75. UI Verification — Providers

Verify provider UI:

* permission-scoped
* provider status honest
* setup-required states clear
* masked config only
* no secret reveal
* test provider action real/setup-required
* delivery logs real/no-data
* retry/DLQ real/setup-required
* webhook status real/setup-required
* audit/status timeline if implemented
* mobile/admin responsive
* no fake green status

If provider status shows active without setup/test:

* create bug
* mark `PARTIAL` or `FAIL`

---

## 76. Responsive Verification

Test at:

```txt id="responsive-widths"
320px
360px
390px
430px
768px
1024px
1366px
```

Check:

* builder campaign list becomes cards
* campaign create form fits
* creative preview fits
* location targeting selector fits
* date/schedule inputs usable
* admin ad table becomes cards
* public Sponsored label visible
* notification dropdown/bottom sheet fits
* notification center usable
* preferences form fits
* provider admin table/cards fit
* delivery logs readable
* no horizontal scroll
* tap targets large
* action menus usable

If not all widths tested, mark responsive check `PARTIAL`.

Do not mark responsive PASS without testing.

---

## 77. Accessibility Verification

Check:

* Sponsored label readable and not color-only
* campaign form labels
* ad creative alt text
* notification bell aria label
* unread count accessible
* notification list semantic
* mark read buttons labelled
* provider status badges not color-only
* admin action buttons labelled
* modals/drawers focus-safe
* errors readable
* keyboard navigation
* large mobile tap targets

If severe accessibility blocker exists:

* create bug
* mark `PARTIAL` or `FAIL`

---

## 78. Performance Verification

Verify:

* public ad query limited/indexed
* ad targeting indexes exist
* impression/click event writes rate-limited/foundation
* notification list paginated
* unread count query indexed
* provider logs paginated
* DLQ list paginated
* no unbounded campaign/admin queries
* no heavy provider SDK in client unnecessarily
* public ad images optimized/lazy
* notification bell does not N+1
* build passes

If notification bell performs unbounded query on every page:

* create bug
* mark `PARTIAL` or `FAIL`

---

## 79. Build / Lint / Typecheck Verification

Run available checks.

Examples:

```txt id="npm-checks"
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm test
```

```txt id="pnpm-checks"
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

If scripts missing:

* record `NOT_CONFIGURED`

If checks fail:

* fix safe issues if in scope
* create bug if unresolved
* mark `FAIL` or `PARTIAL`

Build failure blocks PASS.

---

## 80. Automated Test Suggestions

If test framework exists, add/run tests for:

* builder can create campaign for own published project
* builder cannot create ad for another builder project
* owner/broker cannot create project ad
* active ad view excludes pending/rejected/paused/expired campaigns
* sponsored label component renders
* invalid ad click redirect blocked
* notification recipient is correct
* wrong user cannot read notification
* unread count updates after mark read
* provider setup-required prevents fake send
* provider secrets not returned from status API
* provider webhook idempotency
* RLS tests for ad/notification/provider tables

Document results.

---

## 81. Manual Smoke Test Matrix

If app can run, test:

```txt id="manual-smoke-matrix"
Builder ads:
- builder opens ads dashboard
- builder creates draft campaign for own published project
- builder cannot choose unpublished project
- builder cannot choose another builder's project
- owner/broker denied builder ads
- submit for review creates submitted/under_review status
- campaign not public before approval

Admin ads:
- staff without ads.approve denied
- admin reviews campaign
- reject/request changes requires reason
- approve only when project/RERA/payment gates pass
- action audited if implemented

Public ads:
- active approved campaign appears in correct placement
- Sponsored label visible
- pending/rejected/expired/paused campaign not shown
- click target safe
- impression/click metrics real or no-data

Notifications:
- real event creates notification
- recipient sees own notification
- wrong user denied
- unread count real
- mark read updates count
- no hidden contact in notification

Providers:
- missing provider shows setup-required
- fake email/SMS/WhatsApp not sent
- provider secrets masked
- provider logs/DLQ private
```

If safe test environment unavailable:

* inspect code
* mark runtime tests `SETUP_REQUIRED` or `PARTIAL`
* do not fake runtime PASS

## 96. If Verification Fails

If verification fails:

1. do not start Prompt 13
2. create/update bug entries
3. update `MANUAL_VERIFICATION.md`
4. update `SECURITY_RLS_CHECKLIST.md`
5. update `PERFORMANCE_CHECKLIST.md`
6. update `DEPLOYMENT_ROLLBACK.md`
7. update `API_PROVIDER_STATUS.md` if provider/ad/notification issue found
8. update `brain.md`
9. state exact blocker
10. fix if safe and in scope
11. rerun verification
12. only then proceed

Critical ads/notification/provider/security failures block progress.

## 97. If Verification Is Partial

If verification is partial:

* document exact partial items
* list setup-required providers
* list public ad serving status
* list payment/ad credit/RERA gate gaps
* list provider delivery gaps
* list retry/DLQ/webhook gaps
* list RLS runtime gaps
* list responsive/browser gaps
* confirm no fake active ads
* confirm no fake ad metrics
* confirm no fake provider delivery
* confirm no provider secret leak
* confirm no hidden contact leak
* confirm no wrong-recipient notifications
* confirm no public pending/rejected/unpublished ads
* confirm Sponsored label exists where public ads render
* update docs
* ask/require owner acceptance before Prompt 13 if risk is significant

Acceptable partial examples:

* public ad serving disabled until payment/ad credit verified
* external providers setup-required but in-app notifications work
* impression/click aggregation partial
* fraud/frequency cap partial
* retry/DLQ cron setup-required
* provider webhooks setup-required
* push not started
* RLS runtime tests unavailable but policies reviewed
* responsive checks incomplete

Not acceptable partial without fix:

* fake active ad
* ad without Sponsored label
* fake provider delivery
* provider secret leak
* wrong-recipient notification access
* hidden contact in notification/ad/provider payload
* pending/rejected/unpublished ad public
* open redirect
* private provider logs public
* build fail

## 98. If Verification Passes

If verification passes:

* update `MANUAL_VERIFICATION.md` with PASS
* update `FEATURE_REGISTRY.md`
* update `CHANGELOG.md`
* update `SECURITY_RLS_CHECKLIST.md`
* update `PERFORMANCE_CHECKLIST.md`
* update `DEPLOYMENT_ROLLBACK.md`
* update `API_PROVIDER_STATUS.md` if relevant
* update `brain.md`
* final response should say Prompt 13 can start

Do not start Prompt 13 automatically unless user asked to continue.

## 99. What Not To Do In This Verification

Do not:

* create fake ads to test public slots
* fake ad approval
* fake ad payment
* fake impressions/clicks
* fake provider delivery
* fake unread counts
* mark provider active without config/test
* expose provider secrets
* expose service role
* make provider logs public
* ignore wrong-recipient notification
* ignore hidden contact in notification/ad payload
* allow ad click open redirect
* ignore missing Sponsored label
* bypass RLS
* start Prompt 13 after FAIL/BLOCKED

## 100. Quality Bar

This verification is successful when future phases can trust that:

* ads are builder/project-scoped
* public ads are active, approved and eligible only
* Sponsored label is always visible
* project/RERA/payment/ad credit gates are honest
* metrics are real or no-data
* notifications are recipient-scoped
* unread count is real
* external providers are honest setup/test/active states
* no fake provider delivery exists
* provider secrets are protected
* provider logs and DLQ are private
* RLS protects ad/notification/provider data
* docs reflect reality
* Prompt 13 can build security/privacy/fraud/rate-limit hardening on safe ads/provider foundations
