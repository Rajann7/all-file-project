```

## 6. Responsive Breakpoints

Mandatory verification widths:

|  Width | Device Context                |
| -----: | ----------------------------- |
|  320px | very small mobile             |
|  360px | common Android mobile         |
|  390px | modern iPhone width           |
|  430px | large phone                   |
|  768px | tablet                        |
| 1024px | small laptop/tablet landscape |
| 1366px | desktop                       |

Every major page/flow must be checked at these widths.

Major pages include:

* homepage
* search page
* property detail
* project detail
* auth popup
* property form
* project form
* requirement form
* owner dashboard
* broker dashboard
* builder dashboard
* admin dashboard
* notification center
* billing/pricing
* media upload/gallery
* CMS/legal/blog/support pages

---

## 7. Mobile-First Rules

Mobile-first means:

* design starts at 320px
* content stacks vertically
* primary CTA visible
* filters use bottom sheet
* tables become cards
* sidebars become drawers/bottom nav
* modals become bottom sheets where useful
* tap targets are large
* no horizontal scroll
* no overlapping sticky UI
* forms are sectioned
* media is optimized
* gallery is swipe-friendly
* search is easy to use
* dashboard summaries load first
* heavy charts lazy-load

Mobile-first does not mean desktop should be ignored.

Desktop must still feel premium and spacious.

---

## 8. No Horizontal Scroll Rule

No page should horizontally scroll at required widths.

Common causes to prevent:

* wide tables
* long brand text
* fixed-width cards
* unwrapped URLs
* large images
* overflowing dropdowns
* non-responsive modals
* long buttons
* code blocks
* ad banners
* maps
* gallery thumbnails
* dashboard stat cards
* admin tables

Fix methods:

* use responsive grid
* use min-width carefully
* use `overflow-x-auto` only inside table container when unavoidable
* convert table to cards on mobile
* wrap long text
* truncate safely with tooltip/details
* use responsive images
* use bottom sheets for menus
* avoid fixed pixel widths on mobile

Page-level horizontal scroll is a bug.

---

## 9. Spacing System

Use consistent spacing.

Suggested spacing scale:

* 4px
* 8px
* 12px
* 16px
* 20px
* 24px
* 32px
* 40px
* 48px
* 64px

Rules:

* mobile spacing should be compact but readable
* desktop spacing can be generous
* cards need breathing room
* forms need clear vertical rhythm
* dashboard grids need consistent gaps
* no cramped buttons
* no overlapping sticky bars
* no random inconsistent margins

---

## 10. Typography Rules

Typography must be readable.

Rules:

* use clear font stack
* support Gujarati where needed
* use Noto Sans Gujarati or equivalent for Gujarati
* avoid tiny text
* heading hierarchy clear
* body text readable
* labels visible
* error text readable
* numbers/currency aligned where useful
* cards avoid too much text
* long descriptions collapsed/expanded where needed

Minimum practical text sizes:

* body: readable on mobile
* labels: not too small
* buttons: readable
* metadata: still accessible

Do not use low-contrast grey text for important information.

---
