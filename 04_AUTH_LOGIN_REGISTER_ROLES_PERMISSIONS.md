## 2. Core Auth Principles

Authentication must follow these principles:

1. Public users use mobile OTP login/register.
2. Public user registration supports only Owner, Broker/Agent and Builder/Developer.
3. Admin/staff users use a separate login flow.
4. Admin/staff login must not use public mobile OTP.
5. Admin/staff accounts must be invite-only.
6. Public users cannot create admin/staff accounts.
7. Guest users can browse public-safe content.
8. Guest users cannot reveal hidden contacts.
9. Inquiry/contact protected actions must trigger auth popup.
10. Logged-in users should not see login/register CTA.
11. After login/register, user returns to original intended action where possible.
12. Role must be enforced on server and database, not only in UI.
13. Direct URL bypass must be blocked.
14. RLS must protect sensitive data.
15. Service role key must never be in client.
16. OTP provider missing must show `SETUP_REQUIRED`, not fake sent.
17. Auth errors must be safe.
18. Login/session events must be audited where relevant.
19. Suspicious login behavior must be tracked where implemented.
20. No fake verified role or fake permission state is allowed.

If role does not allow original action:

* show clear role limitation

---

## 7. Logged-In User Header Behavior

| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Owner       | Post Property / Post Requirement         |
| Broker      | Post Property / Post Requirement         |
| Builder     | Post Project                             |
| Admin/Staff | Admin Dashboard only in internal context |
| Guest       | Login/Register                           |

Public header must not expose admin/staff links to public users.

---

## 8. Session Rules

Sessions must be secure and predictable.

Rules:

* session checked server-side for protected routes

* expired session redirects to login/popup
* wrong-role session denied
* suspended/banned session denied
* staff/admin disabled session denied
* session refresh handled safely
* no token exposed in logs
* no raw session object exposed unnecessarily
* public pages must not require session unless protected action
* private pages must not be cached publicly

Admin/staff sessions may require:

* shorter timeout
* device tracking
* suspicious login alert
* re-auth for sensitive actions
* 2FA where implemented/setup-required
* session revoke on staff disable/role change

## 10. Admin / Staff Login System

## 10.1 Internal Login Principles

Admin/staff authentication must be separate from public user auth.

Rules:

* separate URL
* email/Google login only
* no mobile OTP public login
* no public create account
* no self-register
* invite-only
* noindex
* protected by role
* route access checked server-side
* staff permissions checked server-side
* audit login attempts where relevant
* suspicious activity tracked where implemented

---

## 10.2 Internal Login Route

Recommended route:

```txt id="admin-login-route"
/admin/login
```

Alternative internal staff route may be:

```txt id="staff-login-route"
/staff/login
```

Rules:

* no public user registration component
* no mobile OTP field
* no “create account” link
* noindex meta
* robots disallow
* safe error messages
* rate limit login attempts
* redirect logged-in internal user to admin/staff dashboard
* reject public-role users

---

## 10.3 Staff Invite Flow

Staff account creation flow:

1. Super Admin creates invite.
2. Invite includes email, staff role and permissions.
3. Invite token is generated securely.
4. Token is stored hashed.
5. Invite email sent if email provider configured.
6. If email missing, invite is setup-required/manual with safe status.
7. Staff accepts invite.
8. Staff sets up email/Google login.
9. Staff profile created.
10. Staff permissions assigned.
11. Invite marked accepted.
12. Audit log written.

Rules:

* invite expires
* token one-time use
* no raw token stored
* no public staff signup
* disabled staff cannot login
* permission changes audited

---

## 10.4 Super Admin Creation

Super Admin must not be created from public registration.

Allowed methods:

* secure seed/setup script
* protected manual DB setup during initial deployment
* environment-controlled setup command
* invite created by existing Super Admin

Rules:

* no public endpoint to create Super Admin
* no public signup role value `super_admin`
* initial setup must be documented
* Super Admin creation must be audited where possible
* production seed Super Admin credentials must not be hardcoded

---

## 11. Internal Role Permissions

## 11.1 Super Admin

Super Admin can:

* manage everything
* view all modules
* create/edit staff
* manage permissions

* manage plans/pricing/trials/coupons
* manage legal/CMS/SEO
* view audit logs

Super Admin actions still require:

* audit logs
* safe confirmation for destructive actions
* no secret exposure
* no silent hard delete
* no untracked provider change

---

## 11.2 Admin

Admin can access assigned operation modules.

Possible access:

* properties
* projects
* requirements

## 12. Permission Model

Permissions should be modular.

Recommended permission fields:

* `module`
* `can_read`
* `can_write`
* `can_create`
* `can_update`
* `can_delete`
* `can_restore`
* `can_hard_delete`
* `can_approve`
* `can_reject`
* `can_request_changes`
* `can_assign`
* `can_export`
* `can_bulk_action`
* `can_view_sensitive`
* `can_view_private_documents`
* `can_manage_payments`
* `can_refund`
* `can_manual_activate`
* `can_manage_providers`

* before sensitive actions

UI permission hiding is not enough.

## 13. Protected Route Rules

## 13.1 Public Protected Routes

Public dashboard routes require:

* authenticated session
* public role
* correct role
* active account status
* not banned/suspended
* onboarding status where needed
* plan/verification gate where action needs it

Examples:

| Route                                    | Required                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `/dashboard/owner`                       | Owner                                  |
| `/dashboard/broker`                      | Broker                                 |
| `/dashboard/builder`                     | Builder                                |
| `/dashboard/owner/properties/[id]/edit`  | Owner and owns property                |
| `/dashboard/broker/properties/[id]/edit` | Broker and owns property               |
| `/dashboard/builder/projects/[id]/edit`  | Builder and owns project               |

| `/dashboard/*/billing`                   | Authenticated owner of billing account |

---

## 13.2 Admin Protected Routes

Admin routes require:

* internal auth
* staff/admin/Super Admin profile
* active internal account
* permission for module
* noindex
* direct URL blocking
* safe unauthorized page

Examples:

| Route                  | Required                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `/admin/dashboard`     | Internal role                         |
| `/admin/users`         | user read permission                  |
| `/admin/staff`         | staff manage permission               |
| `/admin/providers`     | provider permission / Super Admin     |
| `/admin/payments`      | payment/billing permission            |

Actual table names may vary, but behavior must exist.

---

## 17. Profile Creation Rules

When a public user registers:

1. Supabase Auth user created.
2. `profiles` row created.
3. Role stored as owner/broker/builder.
4. Role-specific profile row created:

   * `builder_profiles`
5. Legal consent stored.
6. Auth event logged.
7. Welcome notification created if implemented.
8. Onboarding prompt shown if profile incomplete.

Profile creation must be atomic where possible.

If role-specific profile creation fails:

---

## 18. Account Status Rules

Public account statuses:

* `active`

| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| active               | normal access                                         |
| pending_verification | access allowed with verification gates where needed   |
| suspended            | login/dashboard restricted, safe message              |
| banned               | login/dashboard blocked, safe message                 |
| deleted              | no normal access, privacy/legal retention rules apply |

Internal staff account statuses:

* `invited`

* mark provider status in `API_PROVIDER_STATUS.md`
* do not fake OTP sent

If OTP provider is missing in production:

* public OTP login cannot be considered PASS

* do not allow fake login
* admin/staff login must remain separate

OTP provider status must be tracked in:

* `API_PROVIDER_STATUS.md`
* `MANUAL_VERIFICATION.md`
* `FEATURE_REGISTRY.md`
* `CHANGELOG.md`
* `brain.md`

## 26. Admin/Staff Security Enhancements

Admin/staff should support or track:

* login attempt limit
* session timeout
* 2FA setup-required/implemented
* suspicious login alert
* device/session tracking
* IP/device hash logging
* forced logout on disable/suspension
* re-auth for sensitive actions where implemented
* maker-checker for high-risk changes
* audit logs
* private data permission
* export permission
* provider settings permission
* payment/refund permission

If not implemented yet, mark `NOT_STARTED` or `SETUP_REQUIRED`, not skipped.

---

## 27. Notifications Related To Auth

Notifications may be created for:

Public users:

* account created
* login from new device where implemented
* role change requested
* role change approved/rejected
* verification requested/approved/rejected
* subscription/plan required
* suspicious activity

Admin/staff:

* new user registration if configured
* role change request
* verification request
* suspicious login
* provider/auth failure
* OTP abuse/rate limit spike

External delivery depends on provider status.

No fake email/SMS/WhatsApp sent status.

## 28. Auth And SEO Rules

Auth/dashboard/admin pages must follow SEO rules:

Public login/register:

* may be noindex if popup-first
* fallback page safe

Dashboards:

* noindex
* private
* not in sitemap

Admin/staff:

* noindex
* disallow in robots
* not in sitemap
* no public metadata exposing internal modules

Public profiles:

* SEO allowed only with public-safe fields
* no private contact
* no hidden contact
* no private verification documents

---

## 29. Auth And Caching Rules

Do not globally cache:

* dashboard pages

* auth session data
* notifications
* billing
* leads
* messages
* private documents
* admin pages
* staff pages
* user-specific saved items
* contact reveal state

Public pages can be cached if they use public-safe data only.

Never cache private user data as public.

## 36. Implementation Order For Auth Phase

Recommended implementation order:

1. create auth utilities
2. configure Supabase client/server client
3. define role types
4. define profile tables/migrations
5. define staff tables/migrations
6. create base RLS policies
7. create public-safe profile view
8. create auth popup UI shell
9. create mobile check flow
10. create registration role selector
11. create OTP setup-required adapter
12. create profile creation server action
13. create dashboard route guards
14. create admin/staff login route shell
15. create staff invite model/admin placeholder
16. create permission helpers
17. add legal consent storage
18. add rate-limit structure
19. add audit/security event structure
20. run tests/manual verification
21. update docs

Provider credentials may be setup-required, but UI/backend must not fake provider success.

---

## 37. Migration Expectations For Auth Phase

Auth phase likely requires migrations for:

* profiles
* role-specific profiles
* staff profiles
* staff invites
* staff permissions
* role change requests
* legal consents
* auth/security events
* rate limit events
* audit logs
* public-safe profile views
* RLS policies

Migration must include:

* table definitions
* indexes
* RLS enable
* RLS policies
* rollback notes
* public-safe views
* no destructive changes unless approved

---

## 38. Auth Security PASS Requirements

Auth phase cannot be `PASS` unless:

* public auth flow exists or provider missing is setup-required
* role selector excludes admin/staff
* public registration creates only owner/broker/builder
* dashboard routes are role-protected
* admin/staff routes are separate
* staff public registration impossible
* direct URL bypass blocked
* RLS base policies exist and are tested where DB exists
* service role not exposed
* hidden contact not exposed through auth flow
* safe errors exist
* rate limits exist or are tracked/blocking if launch
* docs updated
* manual verification updated
* bugs tracked/fixed

If OTP real provider is missing, auth may be `PARTIAL` or `SETUP_REQUIRED` depending phase scope.

## 42. Final Auth Rule

Public users can only register as Owner, Broker/Agent or Builder/Developer.

Admin and staff are separate, invite-only and never public.

Guest can browse but cannot reveal hidden contact.

Logged-in role access must be enforced server-side and with RLS.

Direct URL bypass must be blocked.

OTP provider missing must show setup-required, not fake sent.

Payment/plan/verification gates must be enforced on the server.

No frontend-only security.

No service role in client.

No hidden contact leak.

No fake auth PASS.
