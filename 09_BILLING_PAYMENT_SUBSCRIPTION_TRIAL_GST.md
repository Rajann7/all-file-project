payment_orders
payment_attempts
payments
payment_webhook_events
invoices
invoice_line_items
gst_profiles
coupon_redemptions
trials
trial_redemptions
add_on_purchases
refunds
credit_notes

Plan/coupon/add-on public visibility must be intentional.

If private billing table lacks RLS:

* do not mark complete
* create bug
* mark result `FAIL`

---

## 43. SQL Migration Rule

If DB changes are needed, create migration:

```txt id="migration-name"
supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_billing_payment_subscription_trial_gst.sql
```

Migration must include:

* purpose

* RLS policies created/changed
* indexes created
* invoice sequence/function if any
* webhook idempotency constraints
* destructive changes yes/no

* Supabase/RLS unavailable blocks safe billing
* raw body webhook handling impossible without framework setup
* package/build baseline broken
* architecture conflict needs owner decision

### `SETUP_REQUIRED`

Use for:

* Razorpay keys missing
* Razorpay webhook secret missing
* email provider missing
* PDF generation missing
* GST validation provider missing
* cron/expiry jobs missing
* Supabase env missing

Setup-required is acceptable only if no fake payment/billing functionality appears.

```txt id="next-verification-prompt"
prompts/09_MANUAL_VERIFICATION_BILLING_PAYMENT_SUBSCRIPTION_TRIAL_GST.md
```

Do not start Prompt 10 until Prompt 09 verification passes or is explicitly accepted as `PARTIAL`, `BLOCKED` or `SETUP_REQUIRED`.

## 78. Quality Bar

This phase is successful when future phases can rely on:

* pricing plans are honest
* subscriptions are role-scoped
* posting gates are server-side
* payment success requires verified webhook
* webhook idempotency exists
* invoices are generated only after verified payment/admin event
* invoice numbering is unique
* GST data is protected
* user billing data is own-user-only
* admin billing is permission-scoped
* no provider secrets leak
* no fake payment/invoice/refund/GST exists
* private billing pages are noindex/no-store
* docs accurately updated
* manual verification is ready

## 79. Final Rule For Prompt 09

Implement billing safely.

Payment success only after verified webhook.

Never activate subscription from client callback alone.

Verify Razorpay webhook signature.

Use webhook idempotency.

Use server-side price validation.

Generate invoices only after verified payment or authorized admin event.

Protect GST and billing data.

Protect provider secrets.

Use RLS.

Use private noindex/no-store.

Show setup-required when provider keys are missing.

Do not fake payment.

Do not fake active plan.

Do not fake invoice.

Do not fake GST.

Do not fake refund.

Do not trust client price.

Do not skip migrations for DB changes.

Do not skip docs.

Do not skip checks.

Do not skip manual verification.

No fake PASS.
