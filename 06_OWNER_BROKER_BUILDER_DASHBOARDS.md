## 1. Prompt Identity

```txt id="prompt-identity"
Prompt File: prompts/06_OWNER_BROKER_BUILDER_DASHBOARDS.md
Prompt Number: 06
Phase: Owner, Broker And Builder Dashboards
Type: Implementation Prompt
Matching Verification Prompt: prompts/06_MANUAL_VERIFICATION_OWNER_BROKER_BUILDER_DASHBOARDS.md

## 2. Phase Purpose

The purpose of this phase is to implement secure, useful, role-aware dashboards for authenticated public users.

This phase should implement:

* dashboard shell
* role-aware navigation
* owner dashboard
* broker dashboard
* builder dashboard
* dashboard overview pages
* entity management links
* property/project/requirement management cards
* profile/settings pages
* verification section placeholder/foundation
* billing/subscription placeholder/foundation
* leads/CRM placeholder/foundation
* notifications center foundation
* support/help/ticket entry foundation
* saved items/recently viewed placeholder/foundation
* analytics widgets using real data only
* no fake stats
* no fake counts
* no fake leads
* no fake payment/billing
* no fake verification
* route guards
* RLS-safe data loading
* responsive dashboard UI
* docs updates
* tests/checks
* handoff to manual verification prompt

Dashboards should make all major modules reachable, but unfinished modules must show safe `SETUP_REQUIRED`, `COMING_SOON`, `NOT_STARTED` or `NO_DATA` states instead of fake data.

## 7. Hard Role Access Rules

Dashboard access must be role-specific.

```txt id="role-dashboard-rules"
Owner → /dashboard/owner
Broker → /dashboard/broker
Builder → /dashboard/builder
Guest → denied/login required
Admin/Staff → separate internal admin routes, not public dashboard
```

Rules:

* owner cannot access broker dashboard
* owner cannot access builder dashboard
* broker cannot access owner dashboard
* broker cannot access builder dashboard
* builder cannot access owner dashboard
* builder cannot access broker dashboard
* public user cannot access admin/staff
* admin/staff should not be shown public dashboard links

* title/name
* entity type
* status
* approval status
* visibility
* created/updated date
* published date if any
* basic location
* action menu

Actions:

* edit
* preview if safe/private
* submit
* pause/resume
* delete
* view public page if published
* duplicate later if implemented

Do not show:

* fake views/leads
* hidden contact
* private admin notes unless allowed
* wrong-user data

---

## 40. Private Preview Rules

If dashboard supports preview:

* preview route must require owner/auth
* preview unpublished data only to owner/staff later
* preview noindex
* preview must not leak hidden contact publicly
* public detail route still only published
* preview label clearly visible

If preview not implemented, safe.

---

## 41. Dashboard Search/Filter Rules

For management lists:

* search own entities
* filter by status
* filter by type/category
* filter by approval status
* pagination
* no unbounded reads
* no wrong-user data
* no fake counts

If not implemented, list should still be safe and limited.

---

## 42. Error Handling

Use safe dashboard errors:

```txt id="dashboard-safe-errors"
AUTH_REQUIRED
ROLE_NOT_ALLOWED
FORBIDDEN
ENTITY_NOT_FOUND
SETUP_REQUIRED
FEATURE_NOT_STARTED
NO_DATA
VALIDATION_ERROR
UNKNOWN_ERROR
```

Do not show:

* SQL errors
* stack traces
* service role key
* provider secrets
* hidden contact
* private profile data of others

---

## 43. Loading / Empty / Setup States

Every dashboard module/page must have:

* loading state
* empty state
* error state
* unauthorized state
* setup-required state if provider/module missing
* coming-soon state if later phase
* disabled reason if action not available

No blank modules.

---

## 44. Notification Center Page Foundation

If implementing `/dashboard/.../notifications`:

* show DB-backed notifications if table exists
* otherwise empty/setup-required
* mark all read only if real
* no fake unread badge
* no fake notification list
* no private data
* role-specific safe links only

Full notification system Prompt 12.

---

## 45. Billing Page Foundation

If implementing dashboard billing page:

* show setup-required if billing not ready
* show real plan only if exists
* show invoice list only if real
* no fake invoice
* no fake payment
* no fake active subscription
* no fake usage limits
* pricing link safe
* Razorpay not loaded unless billing implemented

Full billing Prompt 09.

---

## 46. Verification Page Foundation

If implementing verification page:

* show current real verification status
* explain steps
* upload docs disabled/setup-required if media not ready
* request verification button setup/coming soon unless workflow exists
* no fake badge
* no legal guarantee
* builder RERA section shows real entered data only

Full verification/admin approval later.

---

## 47. Support Page Foundation

If implementing support page:

* link to help/support public page if exists
* ticket creation setup-required unless support system exists
* no fake ticket submitted
* no fake reply
* no fake SLA
* safe support copy

Full support ticket system later.

---

## 48. Settings Page Foundation

Settings may include:

* profile basics
* theme preference
* language preference
* notification preferences placeholder
* privacy settings placeholder
* account status
* logout
* role change request placeholder

Rules:

* user edits own safe fields only
* role cannot be changed directly
* email/mobile verification status real
* no private data of other users
* profile image upload setup-required if media not ready

---

## 49. Profile Completeness

Profile completeness can be shown only if computed from real fields.

Allowed:

* show missing fields checklist
* show percentage only if computed deterministically
* no fake verification progress
* no fake badge

If computation not implemented, show profile setup guidance instead.

---

## 50. Security / Privacy Deep Rules

Dashboards must not leak:

* other users’ properties/projects/requirements
* hidden contact of leads/listings
* private profile data
* private documents
* billing data
* admin notes
* moderation notes
* provider statuses intended only for admin
* service role key
* provider secrets

Dashboard pages must not be public cached.

Use `no-store` or equivalent for private pages when applicable.

---

## 51. Performance Requirements

Dashboard implementation must:

* use pagination for lists
* avoid unbounded own entity reads
* avoid N+1 queries
* avoid heavy charts if no real data
* avoid loading admin modules
* avoid loading public search heavy code unnecessarily
* keep mobile dashboard fast
* no maps/payment/media heavy provider scripts
* cache only public-safe data, not private dashboard data

---

## 52. Accessibility Requirements

Dashboards must have:

* semantic layout
* headings
* nav labels
* clear button text
* aria labels for icon buttons
* focus visible
* keyboard navigation
* readable status badges
* status not color-only
* accessible modals/drawers
* confirmation for destructive actions
* large mobile tap targets

---

## 53. Responsive Requirements

Check at least:

```txt id="responsive-widths"
320px
360px
390px
430px
768px
1024px
1366px
```

Dashboards must have:

* no horizontal scroll
* sidebar becomes drawer/bottom nav
* tables become cards
* status badges readable
* action menus usable
* topbar not overlapping
* profile menu usable
* create CTA visible
* cards stack
* no sticky nav covering content
* no destructive action too close to primary action

---

## 54. SQL Migration Rule

This phase should usually not require major DB changes if earlier prompts created foundations.

If DB changes are needed for dashboard support:

* create migration:

```txt id="migration-name"
supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_owner_broker_builder_dashboards.sql
```

Migration must include:

* purpose
* phase: Prompt 06
* tables/views/indexes changed
* RLS policies changed
* destructive changes yes/no
* backup required yes/no
* rollback notes

No DB change without migration.

---

## 55. Possible Dashboard-Support Tables

Only create if needed and justified.

Possible tables:

```txt id="possible-dashboard-tables"
dashboard_preferences
saved_items
recently_viewed_items
notification_preferences
user_settings
profile_completion_events
```

Do not overbuild if later phases handle these.

If tables created, add RLS.

---

## 56. RLS Requirements For New Tables

If new private dashboard tables are created:

* RLS enabled
* user can read/write own rows only
* public denied
* wrong user denied
* staff/admin later permission-scoped
* no private data public views unless explicitly safe
* indexes added

Do not disable RLS.

---

## 57. Tests / Checks To Run

Run available:

```txt id="checks"
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm test
```

or package manager equivalent.

If available, also run:

* route guard tests
* dashboard RLS tests
* component tests
* form/action tests
* responsive smoke checks
* accessibility lint if configured

If script missing, document `NOT_CONFIGURED`.

Do not claim tests passed if not run.

---

## 58. Manual Smoke Checks If App Runs

If app can run, check:

* guest denied dashboard
* owner lands on owner dashboard
* broker lands on broker dashboard
* builder lands on builder dashboard
* owner denied broker/builder dashboard
* broker denied owner/builder dashboard
* builder denied owner/broker dashboard
* public admin route not linked in dashboards
* dashboard lists show own data only
* no fake stats
* no fake leads
* no fake notifications
* no fake billing
* no fake verification
* create buttons route correctly

## 71. Phase Completion Status Rules

### `DONE`

Use when implementation completed but manual verification pending.

### `PASS`

Do not use from implementation prompt alone unless manual verification also completed and documented.

### `PARTIAL`

Use if:

* dashboards exist but some modules are placeholders
* billing/notifications/support/verification setup-required
* leads/CRM placeholders only
* builder ads/agents placeholders only
* some responsive/browser checks pending
* some advanced dashboard filters deferred
* RLS runtime tests pending but route/data checks safe

### `FAIL`

Use if:

* build fails
* guest can access dashboard
* wrong role can access dashboard
* wrong-user data visible
* hidden contact leaks
* fake stats/leads/billing/verification shown
* public admin link visible
* service role/provider secret exposed
* DB changes missing migration
* public dashboard cache risk unresolved

### `BLOCKED`

Use if:

* Prompt 02 auth foundation failed
* Prompt 04/05 entity foundation failed and dashboard depends on it
* cannot inspect required files
* package/build baseline broken
* route architecture conflict needs owner decision

### `SETUP_REQUIRED`

Use for:

* notifications provider missing
* billing/payment provider missing
* media provider missing
* support/email provider missing
* analytics provider missing
* Supabase env missing

Setup-required is acceptable only if UI is honest and no fake data appears.

Show real data only.

Use no-data/setup-required states for unfinished modules.

Do not fake dashboard stats.

Do not fake leads.

Do not fake notifications.

Do not fake billing.

Do not fake verification.

Do not expose hidden contact.

Do not expose wrong-user data.

Do not expose admin links.

Do not leave dead links.
