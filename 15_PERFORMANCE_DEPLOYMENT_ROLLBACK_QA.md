# My Gujarat Property — Performance, Deployment, Rollback, QA And Production Launch System

This document defines the complete **Performance, Scalability, Caching, Deployment, Rollback, QA, Testing, Monitoring and Production Launch System** for **My Gujarat Property**.

Claude must read this file before implementing performance optimization, database indexes, caching, deployment workflows, staging/production setup, SQL migrations, rollback plans, production release gates, smoke tests, load tests, monitoring, incident response, launch checklist or final QA signoff.

No performance claim can be fake.

No deployment can skip backup.

No production migration can skip rollback notes.

No RLS/security-sensitive deployment can be marked PASS without verification.

No payment/provider production release can be marked PASS without real provider testing.

No fake QA PASS is allowed.

## 2. Core Production Principles

The platform must follow these principles:

1. Performance must be real and measured.
2. Public pages must be fast.
3. Dashboard pages must be efficient.
4. Admin pages must be paginated.
5. No unbounded database reads.
6. No fake counts.
7. No fake analytics.
8. No fake provider status.
9. No fake payment status.
10. No public cache of private data.
11. No private data in SEO/cache.
12. No production deployment without backup.
13. No risky migration without rollback notes.
14. No destructive migration without approval and backup.
15. No production release without manual verification.
16. No launch without RLS/security PASS.
17. No payment release without webhook verification.
18. No provider release without setup/test status.
19. Feature flags must protect incomplete/risky features.
20. Rollback path must be documented.
21. Incident response must be ready.
22. Super Admin signoff required for final production launch.
23. No fake PASS.

---

## 3. Scalability Target

Target business expectation:

```txt id="scalability-target"
My Gujarat Property should be designed to support 1 lakh live users with safe scaling practices.
```

This target does not mean every feature is instantly load-tested for 100,000 concurrent users on day one.

It means architecture must avoid obvious bottlenecks:

* unbounded reads
* missing indexes
* huge client bundles
* unoptimized images
* public pages blocked by providers
* database N+1 queries
* no caching strategy
* no pagination
* no queue/retry for provider sends
* no rate limits
* no monitoring
* no rollback plan

Performance target must be implemented progressively and verified honestly.

---

## 4. Performance Status Values

Use these statuses:

| Status             | Meaning                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `NOT_STARTED`      | not implemented                         |
| `IN_PROGRESS`      | being implemented                       |
| `PARTIAL`          | partly implemented, not fully verified  |
| `PASS`             | verified and acceptable                 |
| `FAIL`             | tested and failed                       |
| `BLOCKED`          | cannot proceed due to dependency        |
| `SETUP_REQUIRED`   | provider/config missing                 |
| `NEEDS_LOAD_TEST`  | functionally okay but load not verified |
| `REGRESSION_FOUND` | previous working performance broke      |
| `ROLLED_BACK`      | optimization/deployment rolled back     |

Do not mark `PASS` without evidence.

---

## 5. Core Web Vitals Targets

Public pages should target:

| Metric |  Target |
| ------ | ------: |
| LCP    |  ≤ 2.5s |
| INP    | ≤ 200ms |
| CLS    |   ≤ 0.1 |

Additional targets:

| Area                      | Target                           |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Public page TTFB          | optimized through server/caching |
| Search result interaction | responsive on mobile             |
| Dashboard navigation      | no long blank screens            |
| Admin tables              | paginated and responsive         |
| Image loading             | optimized/lazy below fold        |
| Gallery                   | no huge original images in cards |
| Form submit               | visible loading/error            |
| Provider calls            | timeout-safe                     |

If target cannot be verified yet, mark `PARTIAL` or `NEEDS_LOAD_TEST`.

## 9. Query Safety Rules

Every query must answer:

* who is the user?
* what role?
* what permission?
* what entity ownership?
* what status?
* what visibility?
* what columns are needed?
* what limit?
* what offset/cursor?
* what indexes support it?
* is it public-safe?
* can it leak hidden contact?
* can it be cached?

No query should use broad unrestricted reads in production.

---

## 29. Environment Status Rules

| Environment | Purpose                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| Local       | development only        |
| Preview     | branch/PR preview       |

* RLS disabled
* service role client-side
* fake analytics
* fake verified badges

---

## 30. Deployment Principles

Deployment must:

1. use versioned code
2. use migrations
3. run checks before production
4. backup before risky production DB changes
5. document changed files
6. document SQL migrations
7. document provider changes
8. document feature flags
9. document tests run
10. document manual verification
11. have rollback plan
12. update changelog/docs
13. monitor after deploy

No silent production changes.

---

## 31. Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deployment:

* code committed
* docs updated
* feature registry updated
* changelog updated
* bugs/fixes updated if relevant
* API provider status updated if relevant
* SQL migrations reviewed
* RLS reviewed
* destructive changes identified
* backup plan ready
* rollback plan ready
* feature flags set
* `.env.example` updated
* secrets configured
* lint run
* typecheck run
* build run
* relevant tests run
* manual verification plan ready
* affected routes listed
* affected tables listed
* affected providers listed
* expected user impact noted

---

## 32. Build Gates

Build gates should include:

* install dependencies
* lint
* typecheck
* unit tests where available
* integration tests where available
* build
* route compile check
* migration validation
* RLS tests where applicable
* payment webhook tests where applicable
* provider setup checks where applicable
* bundle size review where needed
* accessibility smoke where possible

If any required gate fails:

* do not mark PASS
* fix or mark BLOCKED/PARTIAL
* document failure

---

## 33. Database Migration Rules

Every DB change must have SQL migration.

Migration file must include:

* timestamped filename
* clear name
* purpose
* phase
* affected tables
* affected policies
* affected indexes
* affected functions/triggers
* destructive change yes/no
* backup required yes/no
* rollback notes
* verification query notes where useful

No undocumented production DB changes.

---

## 34. Migration Naming Rule

Recommended format:

```txt id="migration-name-format"
supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_descriptive_name.sql
```

Examples:

```txt id="migration-examples"
supabase/migrations/20260629120000_create_property_tables.sql
supabase/migrations/20260629123000_add_property_public_indexes.sql
supabase/migrations/20260629130000_add_contact_reveal_rls.sql
```

---

## 35. Destructive Migration Rules

Destructive changes include:

* drop table
* drop column
* rename column without compatibility
* data deletion
* hard delete
* changing enum/check in incompatible way
* changing RLS to be more restrictive without migration plan
* changing RLS to be less restrictive
* changing public-safe views exposing new data
* changing payment/invoice schema
* changing auth/profile core schema

Destructive changes require:

* explicit approval
* backup
* rollback plan
* staging test
* data impact notes
* downtime/maintenance plan if needed
* post-migration verification

---

## 36. Zero-Downtime Migration Strategy

Prefer safe sequence:

1. add new nullable column/table
2. deploy code that writes both old and new if needed
3. backfill safely
4. verify
5. switch reads
6. verify
7. remove old only after backup/approval/final deploy

Avoid:

* immediate drop
* incompatible rename
* blocking long locks
* untested data migration
* production manual edits

---

## 37. Backup Rules

Backup required before:

* production migration
* destructive change
* RLS major change
* payment/invoice schema change
* user/profile/auth schema change
* media cleanup/hard delete
* bulk data update
* location hierarchy bulk import
* plan/pricing bulk change
* major launch release
* rollback-sensitive deploy

Backup must include:

* database backup
* storage/media backup or lifecycle awareness where relevant
* environment/version reference
* migration version
* rollback instructions

No risky production update without backup.

---

## 38. Restore Test Rules

Backups are only useful if restore is tested.

Restore testing should verify:

* backup can be restored
* RLS/policies intact
* core tables present
* critical data present
* media references intact
* invoice/payment records intact
* admin/staff access recoverable
* public site can run against restored DB in safe environment

Production launch should have at least one restore test documented.

---

## 39. RPO / RTO Targets

Recommended targets:

| Metric | Meaning                          | Initial Target           |
| ------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| RPO    | maximum acceptable data loss     | define before production |
| RTO    | maximum acceptable recovery time | define before production |

Business owner/Super Admin must approve final RPO/RTO.

Until defined, production status should be `PARTIAL`.

## 40. Rollback Strategy

Rollback may include:

* code rollback
* feature flag rollback
* database rollback
* provider mode rollback
* cache rollback/purge
* CDN rollback/purge
* migration rollback
* data correction
* maintenance mode
* disabling affected feature

Rollback must be chosen based on incident type.

---

## 41. Code Rollback

Code rollback steps:

1. identify bad release/version
2. confirm incident scope
3. disable feature flag if available
4. rollback to previous stable deploy
5. run smoke tests
6. monitor errors
7. update changelog/incident log
8. create bug/root cause task

Code rollback must consider DB compatibility.

---

## 42. Feature Flag Rollback

Feature flag rollback is fastest for risky features.

Use feature flags for:

* contact reveal
* payment checkout
* ads display
* media upload
* messaging
* provider sends
* maps
* analytics
* admin exports
* bulk actions
* new UI
* advanced search
* public SEO pages

Flag rollback rules:

* backend-enforced
* audit changes
* user-safe disabled state
* no fake success
* docs updated

---

## 43. Database Rollback

Database rollback is risky.

Options:

* reverse migration if safe
* restore backup
* add compatibility patch
* data correction script
* feature flag disable
* hotfix code to support new schema

Rules:

* do not run destructive rollback blindly
* backup before rollback if data changed since migration
* document data loss risk
* test in staging when possible
* Super Admin approval for high-risk rollback

---

## 44. Provider Rollback

Provider rollback may be needed for:

* OTP provider failure
* payment webhook failure
* email/SMS/WhatsApp failure
* R2/CDN failure
* maps failure
* Turnstile false positives
* analytics errors
* error tracking noise

Provider rollback options:

* disable feature flag
* fallback mode
* switch provider mode
* pause sends
* queue retries
* show setup-required/degraded state
* manual processing

No fake provider success.

---

## 45. Cache / CDN Rollback

Cache rollback actions:

* purge CDN for affected paths/assets
* revalidate tags/paths
* disable caching temporarily
* fix public-safe view
* remove leaked asset
* rotate signed URL if needed
* verify sitemap/SEO cache
* verify deleted/paused listing no longer public

If private data cached publicly:

* treat as security incident
* purge immediately
* rotate affected secrets/URLs if needed
* audit exposure
* document incident

---

## 46. Maintenance Mode

Maintenance mode may be used for:

* database migration
* emergency security fix
* payment outage
* provider outage
* data correction
* deployment incident
* storage/CDN issue

Maintenance mode must:

* show safe public message
* protect private data
* noindex if needed
* allow internal bypass if safe
* disable affected actions
* audit enable/disable
* notify users if long outage where provider configured

---

## 47. QA Strategy

* no fake payments
* no fake invoices
* no fake verified badges
* no fake ads
