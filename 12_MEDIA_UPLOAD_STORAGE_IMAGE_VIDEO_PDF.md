## 2. Core Media Principles

Media must follow these principles:

1. Uploads must be validated server-side.
2. Client-side validation is only UX, not security.
3. Storage provider missing means setup-required.
4. Upload success must be real.
5. Private files must never be public.
6. Public media must be public-safe only after approval.
7. Verification documents must use private bucket.
8. RERA proof documents must use private bucket.
9. Support/report evidence may require private bucket.
10. Invoice PDFs must be user-scoped and protected.
11. Hidden contact must not leak through image metadata, PDF metadata or public URLs.
12. EXIF/location metadata should be stripped where possible.
13. SVG must be sanitized or disallowed if unsafe.
14. Video must be limited and lazy-loaded.
15. Project can have one video max.
16. Project brochure PDF must be validated.
17. Floor plans must be public-safe and project-owned.
18. Ad banners must be device-specific and safe.
19. Media metadata must be stored in DB.
20. Media access must be RLS/permission protected.
21. Signed URLs must be used for private files.
22. CDN must not expose private documents.
23. No fake image/video/PDF upload.
24. Orphan media must be cleaned up.
25. Manual verification is required before PASS.

## 3. Media Entity Types

Media may belong to these entities:

| Entity         | Media Type                                                             |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Property       | images, optional brochure where allowed                                |
| Project        | images, one video, brochure PDF, floor plans, progress media, 360 link |
| Requirement    | usually none; optional private attachment where allowed                |
| Profile        | avatar, broker agency logo, builder company logo                       |
| Ad / Promotion | desktop/tablet/mobile banners                                          |
| Verification   | private identity/business/authority/RERA documents                     |
| Message        | private attachments                                                    |
| Support Ticket | private attachments                                                    |
| Report/Fraud   | private evidence attachments                                           |
| CMS Page       | public images                                                          |
| Blog Post      | public images                                                          |
| Invoice        | private invoice PDF                                                    |
| Notification   | rarely media; template image if approved                               |
| Admin/Internal | internal attachments if needed                                         |

Each entity must define whether its media is public or private.

---

## 4. Public Vs Private Media

## 4.1 Public Media

Public media may include:

* approved property images
* approved project images
* approved project brochure if intended public
* approved project floor plans
* approved project video
* approved profile avatar/logo
* approved ad banners
* approved CMS/blog images
* public location/SEO images where implemented

Public media rules:

* must be safe
* must not contain private documents
* must not contain hidden contact if policy disallows
* must not expose private exact location through metadata
* must not expose EXIF GPS
* must not be published before entity approval
* must be cache/CDN safe
* must have metadata and ownership

---

## 4.2 Private Media

Private media includes:

* verification documents
* identity proof
* business proof
* ownership/authority proof
* RERA proof documents
* private support attachments
* report/fraud evidence
* message attachments
* private invoice PDFs
* internal admin attachments
* private legal dispute documents
* private billing documents where restricted

Private media rules:

* private bucket only
* signed URLs only
* access permission required
* access logged for sensitive docs
* no public CDN
* no public direct URL
* no sitemap/SEO
* no raw storage key exposed
* no permanent public link
* no private URL in logs
* no unauthorized preview/download

Private document leak is critical.

---

## 5. Recommended Storage Provider

Recommended provider:

* Cloudflare R2 for object storage
* Cloudflare CDN for public media
* signed URLs or secure proxy for private files
* database metadata in Supabase/PostgreSQL

Storage provider status:

* `SETUP_REQUIRED` until configured
* `CONFIGURED_NOT_TESTED` if env exists but not tested
* `ACTIVE` only after tested upload/read/delete
* `FAILED` if provider failing
* `FALLBACK_ACTIVE` only if real fallback exists

No fake storage success.

---

## 6. Storage Modes

Allowed storage modes:

| Mode                      | Meaning                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `setup_required`          | provider missing                |
| `local_dev_only`          | dev-only local/temp storage     |
| `r2_active`               | Cloudflare R2 active            |
| `supabase_storage_active` | Supabase Storage active if used |
| `fallback_active`         | real fallback active            |
| `disabled`                | uploads disabled                |
| `failed`                  | storage configured but failing  |
| `maintenance`             | temporarily disabled            |

Production must not rely on local dev-only storage.

---

## 7. Bucket Strategy

Recommended bucket separation:

```txt id="bucket-strategy"
public-media/
private-documents/
private-messages/
private-support/
private-invoices/
temp-uploads/
quarantine/
```

Implementation may merge some private buckets if access rules remain strong, but public and private must be separated.

---

## 8. Public Bucket Rules

Public bucket can store:

* approved listing images
* approved project images
* approved public brochure/floor plan files
* public profile avatars/logos
* approved ad banners
* public CMS/blog images

Public bucket must not store:

* identity documents
* RERA proof private docs
* ownership proof
* private messages
* support evidence
* report evidence
* invoice PDFs if private
* private billing documents
* hidden contact files
* raw unapproved media if exposure risk exists

---

## 9. Private Bucket Rules

Private bucket stores sensitive files.

Private bucket access:

* authenticated user owns file
* authorized participant can access
* staff/admin with permission can access
* Super Admin where required
* signed URL generated server-side
* signed URL expiry
* access log for sensitive docs

Private bucket must not:

* expose permanent URLs
* expose storage keys in browser where unsafe
* allow direct guessable access
* cache publicly

---

## 10. Temporary Upload Rules

Temporary uploads may be used during draft flows.

Rules:

* temp uploads are not public

* temp uploads linked to uploader/session
* temp files cleaned up if draft abandoned
* temp files moved/promoted after entity saved/approved where needed
* temp file access scoped
* upload success only after storage write
* no orphan pileup

Temp upload cleanup needs background job or admin/manual cleanup until cron configured.

---

## 11. Quarantine Rules

Quarantine may be used when:

* file scan pending
* file type suspicious
* malware scan failed
* SVG unsafe
* PDF suspicious
* upload validation uncertain
* admin review required

Quarantined files:

* not public
* not downloadable by normal users

* deleted or released after review

Malware/file scanning provider may be setup-required initially.

Exact numbers should be configured during implementation based on infra and plan.

---
