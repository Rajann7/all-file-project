## 2. Core Security Principles

The platform must follow these principles:

1. Security is server-side first.
2. RLS must be enabled for sensitive tables.
3. Frontend hiding is not security.
4. Direct URL bypass must be blocked.
5. Service role key must never be sent to client.
6. Private data must not be in public API payloads.
7. Hidden contact must never be in public HTML.
8. Hidden contact must never be in public metadata/schema.
9. Private documents must never be public.
10. Provider secrets must never be exposed.
11. Payment success must be verified server-side.
12. Webhooks must verify signatures where provider supports it.
13. Admin/staff access must be permission-scoped.
14. Sensitive admin actions must be audited.
15. Logs must redact secrets/private data.
16. Rate limits must protect abuse-sensitive actions.
17. Uploads must validate file type, size and access.
18. Public SEO must use public-safe views only.
19. Fraud/report workflows must protect reporters.
20. Legal disclaimers must be clear and truthful.
21. Production cannot pass without security/RLS/manual verification.
22. No fake security PASS.
