city_or_village
area
locality
society
building
landmark
address_line
pin_code
map_pin_lat_lng_optional

* no fake location data.
* no hidden contact in location labels.
* map pin optional/setup-required if map provider missing.

Missing location request statuses:

```txt id="missing-location-request-statuses"
submitted

## 80. Phase Completion Status Rules

### `DONE`

Use when implementation completed but manual verification pending.

### `PASS`

Do not use from implementation prompt alone unless manual verification also completed and documented.

### `PARTIAL`

Use if:

* location hierarchy foundation exists but full Gujarat master data incomplete
* missing location admin review partial
* SEO pages foundation exists but only key pages enabled
* sitemap split foundation partial
* CMS/legal pages exist but final legal text setup-required
* blog foundation partial
* cookie/privacy preferences partial
* grievance/takedown setup-required
* map provider setup-required
* GSC/analytics setup-required

### `FAIL`

Use if:

* build fails
* private/admin/dashboard pages appear in sitemap
* hidden contact leaks in metadata/schema/sitemap
* fake listing counts/reviews/schema appear

* legal placeholder marked final without review
* public search shows private/pending data
* open redirect exists
* unsafe CMS HTML executes
* RLS missing on private content/request tables
* DB changes missing migration
* empty/thin pages indexed as SEO pages

### `BLOCKED`

Use if:

* Prompt 05 public search/detail SEO foundation failed
* Prompt 10 media integration failed and CMS/blog media depends on it
* Supabase/RLS unavailable blocks content/location tables
* location data source unresolved
* final legal content requirement blocks public legal publish
* package/build baseline broken
* architecture conflict needs owner decision

### `SETUP_REQUIRED`

Use for:

* map/geocoding provider missing
* analytics/GSC missing
* email provider missing for support/grievance
* CMS rich text editor/sanitizer missing
* translation provider missing
* sitemap ping/automation missing

* legal placeholders are not represented as final review
* consent/privacy foundations are private/RLS-protected
* redirects are safe from open redirect/loops
* admin controls are permission-scoped
* no hidden contact leaks through SEO/CMS/legal
* docs reflect reality
* manual verification is ready
