# My Gujarat Property — Prompt 08 Manual Verification: Leads, CRM, Requirements, Proposals And Messages

This prompt is for Claude Code.

Use this prompt immediately after completing:

```txt id="matching-implementation-prompt"
prompts/08_LEADS_CRM_REQUIREMENTS_PROPOSALS_MESSAGES.md
```

This prompt verifies the **Leads, CRM, Requirements, Proposals And Messages** phase.

Do not skip this verification.

Do not start Prompt 09 until this verification is complete or the project owner/Super Admin explicitly accepts a documented `PARTIAL`, `BLOCKED` or `SETUP_REQUIRED` state.

Do not mark PASS without real privacy, participant, RLS, duplicate, status, dashboard, notification, responsive and docs checks.

Do not fake PASS.

```

Record exact changed files.

---

## 7. Migration Verification

If Prompt 08 changed database schema, verify migration exists.

Expected pattern:

```txt id="expected-migration"
supabase/migrations/*_leads_crm_requirements_proposals_messages.sql
```

Verify migration includes:

* purpose
* phase: Prompt 08
* tables created/changed
* views created/changed
* RLS policies created/changed
* indexes created
* functions/triggers if any
* destructive changes yes/no
* backup required yes/no
* rollback notes

If DB changed without migration:

* create critical bug
* mark verification `FAIL`
* do not start Prompt 09

If migration exists without rollback notes:

* create bug
* mark `PARTIAL` or `FAIL` depending data risk

If DB not changed because environment missing:

* mark DB/RLS runtime checks `SETUP_REQUIRED`
* do not claim RLS PASS

---

## 8. Expected Table Verification

If schema exists, check for implemented or reused tables.

Possible tables:

```txt id="expected-tables"
leads
lead_participants
lead_events
lead_notes
lead_followups
contact_requests
contact_reveals
proposals
proposal_events
message_threads
message_participants
messages
message_attachments
site_visits
saved_items
saved_searches
recently_viewed_items
notification_events
user_blocks
user_reports
```

Minimum safe foundation should include:

* lead or inquiry storage
* participant/ownership model
* contact request/reveal status foundation or documented setup-required
* message/proposal/site visit/saved item tables if feature implemented
* RLS enabled
* indexes for ownership/participant queries
* soft/private status where needed
* timestamps

If implementation claims feature complete but table/model missing:

* create bug
* mark `FAIL` or `PARTIAL`

---

## 9. Inquiry Flow Verification

Test or inspect inquiry/contact CTA flow.

Expected flow:

1. guest clicks inquiry/contact
2. auth popup/page opens
3. intent preserved where implemented
4. logged-in user confirms inquiry
5. lead/contact request created
6. duplicate active lead not created
7. receiver can see lead
8. requester can see inquiry status
9. hidden contact remains hidden
10. notification event created only if real DB notification foundation exists

Check:

* no fake inquiry success
* no lead creation for unauthenticated user unless intentionally supported and safe
* no phone/email in response
* no raw SQL/provider error
* safe setup-required if missing dependency

If inquiry button shows success without DB action:

* create bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 10. Lead Creation Verification

Verify lead creation:

* requires auth
* validates target entity
* target entity is approved/published or user-owned/scoped
* requester profile exists
* receiver/uploader profile identified safely
* source tracked
* status initialized correctly
* participants created correctly
* timeline event created if implemented
* duplicate prevention applied
* no hidden contact stored in public payload
* safe response returned

If wrong target/private entity can create public lead:

* create bug
* mark `FAIL` or `PARTIAL`

---

## 11. Duplicate Lead Prevention Verification

Test/inspect duplicate prevention.

Scenarios:

```txt id="duplicate-tests"
same requester + same property + active lead
same requester + same project + active lead
same requester + repeated contact click
same proposer + same requirement + active proposal
double-click inquiry button
browser refresh/resubmit
```

Expected:

* existing lead reused
* duplicate event recorded if useful
* no duplicate active lead spam
* idempotency key if implemented
* safe user message
* no fake count

If duplicate active leads are created on double click:

* create bug
* mark `PARTIAL` or `FAIL` depending severity

---

## 12. Lead Participant Verification

Verify participant model:

* requester can view own lead/inquiry status
* receiver can view lead
* entity owner/uploader can view related lead
* broker/owner sees own property/requirement leads only
* builder sees own project leads only
* wrong user cannot view lead
* wrong user cannot update lead
* admin/staff access permission-scoped
* public denied

If any wrong user can view lead details:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 13. Lead Source Verification

Verify lead sources are real.

Valid examples:

```txt id="lead-sources"
property_detail_contact

project_detail_inquiry
requirement_detail_proposal
requirement_match
search_card_contact
profile_contact
dashboard_manual
admin_manual
support_escalation
```

Check:

* source is allowlisted
* source target is safe
* no hidden contact in source metadata
* no fake source events
* source links to safe entity reference

If source allows arbitrary unsafe values:

* create bug
* mark `PARTIAL`

Do not start Prompt 09.

### BLOCKED

Use `BLOCKED` if:

* Prompt 04 entity foundation failed
* Prompt 06 dashboards failed
* Prompt 07 admin foundation failed where needed
* auth/session unavailable
* Supabase/RLS unavailable blocks safe communication verification
* cannot inspect required files

## 76. If Verification Fails

If verification fails:

1. do not start Prompt 09
2. create/update bug entries
3. update `MANUAL_VERIFICATION.md`
4. update `SECURITY_RLS_CHECKLIST.md`
5. update `PERFORMANCE_CHECKLIST.md`
6. update `DEPLOYMENT_ROLLBACK.md`
7. update `API_PROVIDER_STATUS.md` if provider/privacy issue found
8. update `brain.md`
9. state exact blocker
10. fix if safe and in scope
11. rerun verification
12. only then proceed

Critical privacy/security/participant failures block progress.

---

## 77. If Verification Is Partial

If verification is partial:

* document exact partial items
* list setup-required providers
* list placeholder modules
* list untested runtime/RLS checks
* list responsive/browser gaps
* list rate-limit gaps
* confirm no hidden contact leak
* confirm no public communication data leak
* confirm no wrong participant access
* confirm no fake communication data as real
* confirm private pages noindex/cache safe
* update docs
* ask/require owner acceptance before Prompt 09 if risk is significant

Acceptable partial examples:

* realtime messaging not implemented
* contact reveal action setup-required but contact hidden
* message attachments setup-required
* notification provider delivery setup-required
* site visit reminders setup-required
* rate limiting partial
* admin oversight placeholder only
* RLS runtime tests unavailable but policies reviewed

Not acceptable partial without fix:

* hidden contact leak
* public lead/message access
* wrong participant access
* fake contact reveal
* fake unread counts
* fake proposal acceptance
* private page public cached/indexable
* build fail

## 78. If Verification Passes

If verification passes:

* update `MANUAL_VERIFICATION.md` with PASS
* update `FEATURE_REGISTRY.md`
* update `CHANGELOG.md`
* update `SECURITY_RLS_CHECKLIST.md`
* update `PERFORMANCE_CHECKLIST.md`
* update `DEPLOYMENT_ROLLBACK.md`
* update `API_PROVIDER_STATUS.md` if relevant
* update `brain.md`
* final response should say Prompt 09 can start

Do not start Prompt 09 automatically unless user asked to continue.

## 79. What Not To Do In This Verification

Do not:

* implement payment/subscription
* implement media storage/R2
* implement external SMS/email/WhatsApp delivery
* implement AI lead scoring
* add fake leads
* add fake messages
* add fake unread counts
* add fake proposal accepted/viewed states
* add fake site visit completion
* reveal hidden contact for testing
* bypass RLS
* disable participant checks
* index private communication pages
* cache private communication pages publicly
* expose service role
* expose provider secrets
* ignore wrong participant access
* start Prompt 09 after FAIL/BLOCKED

---

## 80. Quality Bar

This verification is successful when future phases can trust that:

* inquiries create real leads
* duplicate lead prevention works
* leads are participant-scoped
* contact stays hidden unless authorized
* contact reveal foundation is safe
* proposals are participant-scoped
* messages are participant-scoped
* site visits are participant-scoped
* saved items/searches are own-user-only
* notification events do not leak contact
* private communication pages are noindex/no public cache
* RLS protects private communication tables
* dashboards show real/no-data states
* no fake communication data exists
* docs reflect reality
* Prompt 09 billing can safely build on lead/contact/subscription gates
