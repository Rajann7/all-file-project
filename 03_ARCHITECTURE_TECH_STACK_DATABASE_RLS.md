## 4. High-Level System Architecture

The system should be layered like this:

```txt id="architecture-layers"
Browser / Mobile Web
        ↓
Next.js App Router UI
        ↓
Server Components / Client Components
        ↓
Server Actions / Route Handlers / Middleware
        ↓
Validation / Authorization / Rate Limits
        ↓
Supabase Server Client / Provider Adapters
        ↓
PostgreSQL + RLS / Storage / External Providers
        ↓
Audit Logs / Notifications / Background Jobs / Monitoring
```

Key rule:

* UI should improve experience.
* Server actions enforce rules.
* RLS protects data.
* Audit logs record sensitive actions.
* Providers are real or setup-required.
* Manual verification confirms behavior.

---

## 5. App Folder Architecture

Recommended structure:

```txt id="folder-structure"
app/
  (public)/
    page.tsx
    search/
    properties/
    projects/
    profiles/
    blog/
    help/
    legal/
  (auth)/
    login/
    register/
  (dashboard)/
    owner/

types/
  database/
  domain/
  api/
  roles/
  providers/
  billing/
supabase/
  migrations/
  seed/

* admin tables paginated
* mobile cards layout
* secrets never shown raw

---

## 7. Server / Client Boundary

## 7.1 Server-Only Code

Server-only code includes:

* Supabase service role usage
* provider secrets
* Razorpay secret
* webhook verification
* private document signed URL generation
* admin/staff permission checks
* RLS-sensitive queries
* payment order creation
* invoice generation
* provider status test calls
* cron jobs
* audit log writes
* security event writes
* private media operations
* data export/delete requests

Server-only code must not be imported into client components.

---

## 7.2 Client-Safe Code

Client components may handle:

* UI interaction
* popups
* drawers
* bottom sheets
* form state
* upload progress UI
* copy buttons
* galleries
* carousels
* maps display if provider configured
* theme toggle
* filter UI
* optimistic UI where safe
* local guest saved/recent state where allowed

Client code must not contain:

* service role key
* provider secrets
* hidden contact data before reveal
* private document URLs
* payment secret
* raw private user data
* admin private data
* staff secrets
* server-only functions

---

## 8. Data Access Pattern

Use layered data access.

Recommended:

```txt id="data-access-pattern"
UI Component
  ↓
Server Component / Server Action
  ↓
Validation
  ↓
Authorization / Permission Check
  ↓
Query Service / Mutation Service
  ↓
Supabase Client
  ↓
PostgreSQL + RLS
```

Rules:

* do not query database directly from random UI components without pattern
* use reusable query/service functions
* use typed returns
* separate public-safe queries from private queries
* separate admin queries from user queries
* validate inputs before DB access
* check auth/role/ownership before mutation
* rely on RLS as final protection

---

## 9. Validation Architecture

Validation must exist on server side.

Recommended:

* TypeScript types
* validation schemas
* safe parsing
* typed errors
* common validation utilities
* per-module validation files

Validate:

* mobile number
* email
* role
* name
* property type
* project type
* purpose
* price
* budget
* area
* location IDs
* address
* pin code
* RERA number
* GSTIN
* URLs
* iframe URLs
* uploaded files
* payment plan ID
* coupon code
* proposal data
* message data
* CMS slug/meta
* admin action reason
* provider setting values
* feature flag values

Client validation improves UX.

Server validation enforces safety.

---

## 10. Error Architecture

Use typed safe errors.

Allowed user-facing error types:

* `UNAUTHORIZED`
* `FORBIDDEN`
* `NOT_FOUND`
* `VALIDATION_ERROR`
* `RATE_LIMITED`
* `SETUP_REQUIRED`
* `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE`
* `PAYMENT_PENDING`
* `PAYMENT_FAILED`
* `PAYMENT_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED`
* `UPLOAD_FAILED`
* `APPROVAL_REQUIRED`
* `SUBSCRIPTION_REQUIRED`
* `VERIFICATION_REQUIRED`
* `FEATURE_DISABLED`
* `SERVER_ERROR`

Do not expose:

* SQL error
* stack trace
* provider secret
* raw payment payload
* raw webhook payload
* RLS internals
* internal file path
* private data existence
* service role details

---

## 11. Database Design Principles

Database must support marketplace complexity.

Principles:

1. Normalize core entities.
2. Use status fields for workflows.
3. Use audit logs for sensitive actions.
4. Use soft delete for important records.
5. Use indexes for frequent filters.
6. Use public-safe views for public pages.
7. Use RLS for sensitive tables.
8. Use enums/check constraints where useful.
9. Avoid storing secrets in database.
10. Store provider metadata, not secret values.
11. Keep payment states immutable/auditable.
12. Keep invoice numbering safe.
13. Keep private document metadata private.
14. Keep public media separate from private media.
15. Keep role permissions explicit.
16. Keep notification logs separate from notifications.
17. Keep admin notes internal.
18. Keep user-facing legal consent records.
19. Keep retention/soft-delete strategy clear.
20. Keep migrations reversible where possible.

---

## 12. Core Database Domains

The database should cover these domains:

1. auth/profile/roles
2. staff/admin permissions
3. location hierarchy
4. properties
5. projects
6. project units/inventory
7. requirements
8. matching/proposals
9. leads/CRM
10. messages
11. site visits
12. saved items/searches/recent views
13. verification/trust
14. media/storage
15. billing/subscriptions/plans
16. payments/webhooks/invoices/GST
17. ads/promotions
18. notifications/delivery logs
19. support/help tickets
20. reports/fraud
21. CMS/blog/legal/SEO
22. provider settings/status
23. feature flags/settings
24. audit logs/security events
25. analytics/events/aggregates
26. cron/jobs/dead letters
27. privacy/data requests
28. deployment/system health records where needed

## 15. RLS Strategy

RLS must be designed from the beginning.

## 15.1 RLS Principles

1. Enable RLS on all sensitive tables.
2. Guest can access only approved public-safe data.
3. Authenticated user can access own private data.
4. Owner can manage own properties/requirements.
5. Broker can manage own properties/requirements/proposals.
6. Builder can manage own projects/agents/ads.
7. Builder agents see assigned data only.
8. Staff access is permission-scoped.
9. Super Admin access is allowed where intended.
10. Private documents require strict access.
11. Payment/billing records are owner/admin scoped.
12. Webhook events are server/admin only.
13. Audit logs are admin/audit scoped.
14. Provider settings are Super Admin/system scoped.
15. Public-safe views exclude private fields.
16. RLS must be tested with allowed and denied cases.
17. RLS is not disabled for convenience.
18. RLS changes require migration.
19. RLS failure blocks launch.

---

## 15.2 Public RLS Pattern

Public users may read:

* approved published public properties
* approved published public projects
* published CMS/blog/legal pages
* public-safe broker/builder profiles
* active public plans/pricing
* approved active ads
* public location hierarchy
* public SEO pages

Public users must not read:

* hidden phone
* private email
* private profile fields
* private address fields where not public
* leads
* messages
* requirements not public/allowed
* proposals
* payments
* invoices
* private documents
* verification documents
* audit logs
* staff/admin data
* provider settings
* feature flags
* webhook events
* raw notification logs
* internal notes

---

## 15.3 Authenticated User RLS Pattern

Authenticated public users can:

* read/update own profile
* read own dashboards
* manage own allowed listings
* manage own requirements
* view own leads
* view own messages
* view own notifications
* view own billing/invoices
* submit support/report
* submit verification
* access private documents they own where allowed

They cannot:

* access another user’s private data
* bypass role restrictions
* bypass listing ownership
* bypass approval
* bypass subscription gates
* bypass payment checks
* access admin/staff data

---

## 15.4 Staff/Admin RLS Pattern

Staff/admin access should combine:

* separate auth
* staff profile
* staff permission table
* server-side permission checks
* RLS policies or secure server-side access
* audit logs

Staff must be denied if:

* not assigned module
* lacking action permission
* lacking sensitive data permission
* lacking private document permission
* lacking export permission
* lacking payment/refund permission
* direct URL bypass attempted

Super Admin has broad access but still audited.

---

## 15.5 Service Role Pattern

Service role may be used for:

* trusted server-only admin operations
* webhooks
* background jobs
* cron
* provider callbacks
* controlled migrations
* server-side system tasks

Service role must not be used:

* in client components
* in public browser code
* in exposed bundles
* to bypass app permission checks casually
* for user-facing actions without explicit authorization

Service role access must be wrapped in safe server-only functions.

---

## 16. Public-Safe Views

Use public-safe views or carefully mapped queries for public pages.

Recommended public-safe views:

* `public_properties`
* `public_projects`
* `public_project_units_summary`
* `public_broker_profiles`
* `public_builder_profiles`
* `public_ads`
* `public_cms_pages`
* `public_blog_posts`
* `public_seo_pages`
* `public_locations`
* `public_pricing_plans`

Public-safe views must exclude:

* hidden contacts
* private email
* private phone
* private docs
* private notes
* internal moderation status except public status
* raw verification documents
* payment data
* private lead data
* admin fields
* provider config
* audit/security events

Views should include only fields required by public pages.

---

## 17. RLS Test Requirements

For each sensitive table, test:

* guest allowed case
* guest denied case
* correct owner allowed
* wrong owner denied
* correct role allowed
* wrong role denied
* staff with permission allowed
* staff without permission denied
* Super Admin allowed where intended
* private data denied publicly
* deleted/draft/rejected hidden
* public-safe view excludes private fields

RLS tests must be recorded in:

* `SECURITY_RLS_CHECKLIST.md`
* `MANUAL_VERIFICATION.md`
* `BUGS_AND_FIXES.md` if failed
* `CHANGELOG.md`
* `FEATURE_REGISTRY.md`

---

## 18. Migration Architecture

All DB changes must use SQL migrations.

Migration folder:

```txt id="migration-folder"
supabase/migrations/
```

Migration naming:

```txt id="migration-naming"
YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_phase_XX_short_description.sql
```

Example:

```txt id="migration-example"
20260629093000_phase_02_auth_roles_rls_foundation.sql
```

Migration header:

```sql id="migration-header"
-- Migration: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_phase_XX_short_description.sql
-- Project: My Gujarat Property
-- Purpose:
-- Phase:
-- Related docs:
-- Tables changed:
-- RLS changed: Yes/No
-- Destructive changes: Yes/No
-- Backup required: Yes/No
-- Rollback notes:
-- Created by:
```

Every migration must include rollback notes.

Destructive migration requires user approval and backup.

---

## 19. Indexing Strategy

Indexes are required for:

* role lookups
* profile lookups
* ownership filters
* status filters
* city/locality search
* price/budget range
* type/purpose filters
* published_at sorting
* slug lookup
* admin queues
* verification queues
* leads CRM
* messages/unread counts
* notifications
* payment provider IDs
* webhook event IDs
* invoice number
* ad targeting
* audit logs
* location hierarchy
* support tickets
* reports
* media entity mapping

No unindexed heavy search/filter queries should ship.

No unbounded reads.

No N+1 patterns.

---

## 20. Caching Architecture

## 20.1 Cache Public Data Safely

Cacheable:

* homepage public sections
* public property/project search where safe
* public detail pages
* public SEO pages
* public CMS/legal pages
* public blog pages
* public location lists
* public pricing plans
* public approved ads with safe TTL

Do not cache globally:

* dashboards
* leads
* messages
* notifications
* billing
* invoices
* private profiles
* admin/staff pages
* private documents
* contact reveal state
* payment state
* provider settings with sensitive fields

---

## 20.2 Revalidation Strategy

Use targeted revalidation.

Examples:

* property approval/update → property detail/search/city tags
* project approval/update → project detail/search/city tags
* requirement update → requirement feed/dashboard tags
* profile update → public profile/dashboard tags
* lead update → related dashboard tags
* payment success → billing/subscription dashboard tags
* ad approval/pause → homepage/city ad tags
* CMS/legal update → page path/tag
* location update → location/search/SEO tags

Do not revalidate whole site unnecessarily.

---

## 21. Storage Architecture

Buckets:

* public media bucket
* private document bucket

Public bucket may contain:

* approved property images
* approved project images
* public project brochure if allowed
* public floor plans where allowed
* public profile images/logos
* approved banner ads
* public blog/CMS images

Private bucket must contain:

* verification documents
* identity/business/authority proof
* support private attachments
* report evidence where private
* private invoices if restricted
* private signed documents

Rules:

* private files never public
* signed URLs expire
* access logged
* staff permission required
* public CDN must not serve private files
* upload validation server-side
* media metadata tracked in DB
* orphan cleanup background job
* CDN purge on update/delete where needed

---

## 22. Provider Adapter Architecture

Use provider adapters.

Recommended structure:

```txt id="provider-adapter-structure"
lib/providers/
  otp/
  sms/
  email/
  whatsapp/
  razorpay/
  maps/
  storage/
  analytics/
  error-tracking/
  turnstile/
  geoip/
  pdf/
  media-processing/
```

Provider adapter rules:

* consistent interface
* server-only secrets
* setup-required detection
* safe error mapping
* retry behavior where needed
* idempotency where needed
* delivery/payment/upload logs
* no fake success
* provider status update
* audit provider setting changes

---

## 23. Payment Architecture

Payment flow:

```txt id="payment-flow"
User selects plan/add-on/ad
        ↓
Server validates role/plan/amount
        ↓
Server creates Razorpay order
        ↓
Client opens checkout with public key/order
        ↓
Payment attempted
        ↓
Webhook verifies signature
        ↓
Payment event processed idempotently
        ↓
Subscription/add-on/ad activated only after verified success
        ↓
Invoice generated
        ↓
Notification/email queued if provider configured
```

Rules:

* client amount not trusted
* server validates plan amount
* webhook signature mandatory
* idempotency mandatory
* failed/pending inactive
* invoice after verified success
* manual activation audited
* no fake payment success

---

## 24. Notification Architecture

Notification types:

* in-app
* email
* SMS
* WhatsApp
* push where enabled

In-app notifications are DB-backed.

External notification providers are setup-required until configured.

Notification flow:

```txt id="notification-flow"
Event occurs
  ↓
Create notification record
  ↓
User sees in-app notification
  ↓
External delivery job queued if provider/channel enabled
  ↓
Provider adapter sends
  ↓
Delivery log updated
  ↓
Failure retry/fallback
```

Rules:

* unread count real
* no fake delivered status
* provider failure safe
* preferences respected
* quiet hours/digest where implemented
* deep links safe
* role-scoped notifications

---

## 25. Audit Architecture

Audit logs required for:

* admin/staff actions
* role changes
* verification actions
* approval/rejection
* payment manual actions
* refund/credit note
* provider setting changes
* feature flag changes
* private document access
* contact reveal
* exports
* bulk actions
* deletes/restores
* high-risk security changes
* CMS/legal publish
* ad approval
* location approval

Audit logs must be append-only and safe.

No secrets in audit logs.

---

## 26. Rate Limit Architecture

Rate limits required for:

* OTP send
* OTP verify
* login attempts
* contact reveal
* inquiry submit
* proposal submit
* message send
* upload
* report submit
* support ticket create
* payment order create
* coupon apply
* provider test buttons
* search scraping risk
* admin login
* webhook retry

Rate limit keys may include:

* IP hash
* user ID
* mobile hash
* device/session hash
* action type

Do not store raw sensitive identifiers where avoidable.

---

## 27. Background Job Architecture

Background jobs should handle:

* media processing
* video thumbnail generation
* PDF generation
* notification sending
* failed provider retry
* webhook reconciliation

* listing expiry
* subscription/trial expiry
* ad expiry
* orphan media cleanup
* soft delete purge
* analytics aggregation
* fraud checks
* RERA recheck where implemented
* provider health checks

Rules:

* idempotent
* batched
* safe retry
* dead-letter queue
* logs redacted
* cron protected
* not blocking user requests

---

## 28. SEO Architecture

SEO architecture must support:

* static/dynamic metadata
* canonical URLs
* noindex logic
* sitemap generation
* robots.txt
* city/locality/type pages
* listing detail pages
* project detail pages
* public profiles
* CMS/legal/blog pages
* schema markup
* public-safe data only
* no fake counts
* empty/thin noindex/hidden
* admin/staff noindex
* redirect manager
* slug management
* sold/rented/expired handling
* sitemap split if large

SEO must not leak private data.

---

## 29. Internationalization / Localization Architecture

Language support should allow:

* English
* Hindi
* Gujarati
* transliteration search
* Indian currency formatting
* IST timezone
* Indian date formats
* Indian phone number handling
* NRI/ISD fallback where implemented
* Gujarati font support

Recommended:

* translation dictionary structure
* language preference in profile/session
* SEO language metadata where needed
* Noto Sans Gujarati or suitable Gujarati font
* server/client formatting utilities

Current scope may start with one language and architecture-ready localization, but missing localization must be tracked.

---

---

## 32. Deployment Architecture

Environments:

* local
* development
* staging
* production
* preview
* maintenance

Deployment requirements:

* `.env.example`

## 42. Final Architecture Rule

Build My Gujarat Property as a real, secure, scalable and maintainable marketplace.

Architecture must protect users, data, payments, documents, contacts and platform trust.

Do not build shortcuts that create security leaks.

Do not create fake data or fake states.

Do not expose secrets.

Do not skip RLS.

Do not skip migrations.

Do not skip provider setup-required states.

Do not skip performance basics.

Do not skip manual verification.

A feature is architecture-complete only when its routes, data model, server logic, RLS, provider status, UI states, docs and verification all align.
