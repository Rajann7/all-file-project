---

## 7. Hard Performance And Deployment Rules

Claude must enforce:

```txt id="hard-performance-deployment-rules"
No private data in public cache.
No dashboard/admin caching as public.
No stale private signed URLs in cache.
No service role in client for performance.
No disabling RLS for performance.
No removing security checks for speed.
No fake Core Web Vitals.
No fake build pass.
No fake deployment.
No fake monitoring.
No fake rollback readiness.
No fake launch readiness.
```

Forbidden:

* caching personalized pages with public cache
* caching notification/billing/leads/messages pages publicly
* using `select *` on large/private tables
* unbounded public APIs
* full original images on search cards
* hiding build/test failures
* marking provider active without test
* marking rollback tested without test
* deleting features to make build pass without approval
* disabling validations/RLS to improve speed

---

## 8. Performance Targets

Target Core Web Vitals:

```txt id="core-web-vitals-targets"
LCP: <= 2.5s
INP: <= 200ms
CLS: <= 0.1
TTFB: as low as practical for hosting/database setup
```

Target behavior:

* mobile-first
* fast first load on public pages
* no layout shift in image galleries/cards
* search results usable quickly
* dashboard lists paginated
* admin queues paginated
* upload/media UI responsive
* notification bell lightweight
* no N+1 loops
* no unbounded data fetches

If exact measurement tools are unavailable, implement foundations and mark runtime measurement `SETUP_REQUIRED` or `PARTIAL`.

Do not invent measured numbers.

---

## 9. 1 Lakh Users Readiness Foundation

The product requirement expects readiness for high traffic.

This phase should prepare for scale by:

* paginating all large lists
* indexing common filters
* caching public pages safely
* avoiding expensive counts
* using CDN for media
* avoiding client bundle bloat
* protecting public APIs with rate limits
* avoiding N+1 queries
* using public-safe materialized/views where appropriate
* separating read-heavy public pages from private dashboards
* monitoring query errors/latency foundation
* documenting load test status

Do not claim verified for 1 lakh live users without real load test.

Use `FOUNDATION_READY`, `PARTIAL`, or `LOAD_TEST_REQUIRED`.

---

---

## 12. Next.js Caching Strategy

If using Next.js App Router, define safe usage for:

```txt id="next-cache-tools"
dynamic = "force-dynamic"
dynamic = "force-static"
revalidate
fetch cache options
unstable_cache if used
revalidatePath
revalidateTag
cache tags
headers/cookies based dynamic rendering
server actions after mutation
```

Rules:

* public static/CMS/SEO pages can use safe revalidation.
* public listing pages can use short/controlled revalidation if data safe.
* private dashboard/admin/billing/messages/notifications must be dynamic/no-store.
* mutation must revalidate affected public pages.
* signed URLs must not be cached publicly.
* user-specific fetches must not use shared cache.
* provider/admin pages no-store.

---

## 13. Cache Tag Strategy

Recommended cache tags:

```txt id="cache-tags"
home
search
properties
property:{id}
projects
project:{id}
profiles
profile:{id}
locations
location:{id}
seo
cms
cms:{slug}
blog
blog:{slug}
legal
ads
ads:{placement}
sitemap
media:{id}
```

Rules:

* cache tag invalidation after create/update/approve/reject/delete/publish.
* listing approval should invalidate search/location/home/detail if public.
* media update should invalidate affected detail/search/profile.
* ad approval/pause should invalidate ad placement cache.
* CMS/legal/blog publish should invalidate public page/sitemap.
* private data should not be cached by shared tag.

If cache tags are not implemented, document route-level fallback.

---

## 14. Private Cache Control Requirements

site-visits
billing
payments
invoices
GST
notifications
provider logs

Rules:

* do not weaken RLS for speed.
* add indexes/helpers instead.
* use security definer functions only if safe and documented.
* public-safe views should not leak private fields.
* test policy behavior after optimization.

## 78. Launch Readiness Status Values

Use these statuses:

```txt id="launch-readiness-statuses"
NOT_READY
FOUNDATION_READY
PARTIAL
BLOCKED
SETUP_REQUIRED
READY_FOR_FINAL_SIGNOFF
```

Prompt 14 should usually end with:

* `FOUNDATION_READY` if implementation complete and verification pending.
* `PARTIAL` if some setup providers/load tests/monitoring remain.
* `BLOCKED` if critical issues remain.

Only Prompt 15 should issue final production signoff.

---

## 79. Phase Completion Status Rules

### `DONE`

Use when implementation completed but manual verification pending.

### `PASS`

Do not use from implementation prompt alone unless manual verification also completed and documented.

### `PARTIAL`

Use if:

* Lighthouse/Core Web Vitals runtime measurement unavailable
* load test not performed
* monitoring provider setup-required
* error tracking setup-required
* durable cache/purge provider setup-required
* backup restore test setup-required
* CDN purge partial
* feature flags partial
* maintenance mode partial
* staging environment unavailable
* browser/device checks pending
* some provider statuses setup-required but core app safe

### `FAIL`

Use if:

* build fails
* typecheck fails
* lint has blocking errors
* private page publicly cached
* dashboard/admin static/public cached
* private signed URL cached
* search/detail broken
* critical route broken
* private data in sitemap/cache
* hidden contact public
* RLS/security weakened for performance
* deployment rollback docs missing for migration
* DB changes missing migration
* fake performance/deployment/monitoring claimed

### `BLOCKED`

Use if:

* Prompt 13 security verification failed
* critical security bug open
* Supabase/RLS unavailable blocks deployment readiness
* provider/env architecture unresolved
* hosting/deployment target unknown and required
* migration strategy unresolved
* package/build baseline broken
* cannot inspect required files

### `SETUP_REQUIRED`

Use for:

* monitoring provider missing
* error tracking missing
* analytics/GSC missing
* CDN purge API missing
* backup provider missing
* staging environment missing
* load test tooling missing
* Lighthouse tooling missing
* production env missing
* hosting config missing
* cron/jobs missing

Setup-required is acceptable only if no fake launch readiness is claimed and no critical blocker remains.

## 81. Matching Manual Verification Reminder

After this implementation prompt, run:

```txt id="next-verification-prompt"
prompts/14_MANUAL_VERIFICATION_PERFORMANCE_CACHING_DEPLOYMENT_LAUNCH.md
```

Do not start Prompt 15 until Prompt 14 verification passes or is explicitly accepted as `PARTIAL`, `BLOCKED` or `SETUP_REQUIRED`.

## 83. Quality Bar

This phase is successful when future phases can rely on:

* public pages are optimized and safely cached
* private pages are not publicly cached
* search/detail/dashboard/admin queries are bounded
* images/media use optimized variants
* bundle bloat is reduced or documented
* DB indexes support major filters
* RLS performance is reviewed without weakening security
* deployment checklist exists
* rollback playbook is current
* feature flags and maintenance mode foundation exist or status documented
* provider/env status is honest
* monitoring/health foundation exists or setup-required
* launch freeze/post-deploy smoke checklist is ready
* no fake performance/deployment/launch claims exist
* manual verification is ready

## 84. Final Rule For Prompt 14

Optimize performance honestly.

Cache public pages safely.

Never cache private pages publicly.

Never weaken RLS/security for speed.

Use real build/check results.

Use real provider statuses.

Use real deployment readiness.

Use setup-required where infrastructure is missing.

Do not fake Core Web Vitals.

Do not fake load test.

Do not fake monitoring.

Do not fake rollback.

Do not fake launch readiness.

Do not hide build failures.

Do not cache signed URLs publicly.

Do not put private URLs in sitemap.

Do not skip migrations for DB changes.

Do not skip docs.

Do not skip checks.

Do not skip manual verification.

No fake PASS.
