* inquiry status page/foundation
* saved items
* messages
* site visits
* follow-ups if applicable
* no fake leads

### Broker Dashboard

Add/fix:

* leads/CRM
* proposals
* messages
* follow-ups
* site visits
* saved items
* requirement leads
* no fake pipeline

### Builder Dashboard

Add/fix:

* project leads
* matching requirements
* proposals
* messages
* site visits
* ads leads placeholder if ads not implemented
* no fake leads/matches

All dashboards must show own/participant data only.

---

## 34. Admin Oversight Requirements

Admin/staff may need oversight for abuse/support.

This phase may add admin placeholder pages or integrate with Prompt 07.

Admin oversight:

* lead list permission-scoped
* report/fraud queue placeholder
* message moderation placeholder
* contact reveal audit/log view placeholder
* no hidden contact to unauthorized staff
* no private messages visible unless permission and policy allow
* actions audited

If full admin oversight not implemented, document `PARTIAL`.

---

## 35. RLS Requirements

RLS must protect all lead/communication tables.

General rules:

* public denied
* participants can read own leads/threads/proposals/site visits
* entity owner/uploader can read related leads
* requester can read own inquiry status
* sender/recipient can read own messages
* wrong user denied
* admin/staff permission-scoped
* service role server-only
* no hidden contact public
* no private notes to wrong participant
* no admin notes to public users

Frontend hiding is not security.

---

## 36. RLS Table Expectations

If tables are created, enable RLS for:

```txt id="rls-tables"
leads
lead_participants
lead_events
lead_notes
lead_followups
contact_requests
contact_reveals
proposals
proposal_events
message_threads
message_participants
messages
message_attachments
site_visits
saved_items
saved_searches
recently_viewed_items
notification_events
user_blocks
user_reports
```

If any private communication table lacks RLS:

* do not mark complete
* create bug
* mark implementation result `PARTIAL` or `FAIL`

---

## 37. SQL Migration Rule

If DB changes are needed, create migration:

```txt id="migration-name"
supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_leads_crm_requirements_proposals_messages.sql
```

Migration must include:

* purpose
* phase: Prompt 08
* tables created/changed
* views created/changed
* RLS policies created/changed
* indexes created
* functions/triggers if any
* destructive changes yes/no
* backup required yes/no
* rollback notes

No DB change without migration.

---

## 38. Suggested Indexes

Add/verify indexes for:

### Leads

* requester_profile_id
* receiver_profile_id
* target_type
* target_id
* status
* crm_stage
* source
* created_at
* updated_at

### Lead Participants

* lead_id
* profile_id
* participant_role

### Contact Requests / Reveals

* requirement_id
* property_id
* project_id
* status
* created_at

### Messages

* thread_id
* sender_profile_id
* created_at
* status

### Message Participants

* thread_id
* profile_id
* last_read_at

### Site Visits

* lead_id
* requester_profile_id
* host_profile_id
* scheduled_at
* status

### Saved/Recent

* profile_id
* item_type
* item_id
* created_at

### Notifications

* recipient_profile_id
* notification_type
* read_at
* created_at

## 39. Server Action / API Requirements

Implement safe server actions/API routes for:

```txt id="server-actions"
create_inquiry
create_or_get_lead
request_contact_reveal
approve_contact_reveal
reject_contact_reveal
update_lead_stage
add_lead_note
create_followup
complete_followup
send_proposal
update_proposal_status
create_message_thread
send_message
mark_thread_read
archive_thread
block_user
report_user_or_message
request_site_visit
respond_site_visit
reschedule_site_visit
cancel_site_visit
save_item
unsave_item
save_search
delete_saved_search
track_recently_viewed
```

Only implement what is in scope and safe.

Each action must:

* require auth
* validate input
* verify participant/ownership/role
* enforce RLS
* prevent duplicates where needed
* sanitize text
* protect hidden contact
* create audit/event where needed
* return safe typed errors
* not expose secrets/private data

---

## 40. Error Handling Rules

Use safe errors:

```txt id="safe-errors"
AUTH_REQUIRED
ROLE_NOT_ALLOWED
FORBIDDEN
ENTITY_NOT_FOUND
LEAD_NOT_FOUND
THREAD_NOT_FOUND
NOT_PARTICIPANT
CONTACT_REVEAL_NOT_AUTHORIZED
CONTACT_ALREADY_REQUESTED
DUPLICATE_LEAD
VALIDATION_ERROR
RATE_LIMITED
SETUP_REQUIRED
MESSAGING_SETUP_REQUIRED
MEDIA_PROVIDER_SETUP_REQUIRED
NOTIFICATION_PROVIDER_SETUP_REQUIRED
INVALID_STATUS_TRANSITION
UNKNOWN_ERROR
```

Do not expose:

* SQL errors
* stack traces
* service role
* provider secrets
* hidden contact
* private notes
* private profile data
* message content to non-participants

---

## 41. Input Validation Rules

Validate:

* target entity type

* proposal fields
* budget/price values
* site visit date/time

* report category
* block target
* status transitions
* role permission

Invalid data must not be saved.

---

## 42. Status Transition Rules

Lead status transitions should be validated.

Example:

```txt id="lead-status-transitions"
new → open
open → contact_requested
contact_requested → contact_shared
contact_requested → contact_denied
open → contacted
contacted → interested
interested → follow_up
follow_up → site_visit_requested
site_visit_requested → site_visit_scheduled
site_visit_scheduled → negotiation
negotiation → converted
negotiation → lost
any active → closed
any active → spam
any active → blocked
closed → archived
```

Proposal transitions:

```txt id="proposal-status-transitions"
draft → sent
sent → viewed
sent → shortlisted
viewed → shortlisted
shortlisted → negotiation
negotiation → accepted
negotiation → rejected
sent → withdrawn
sent → expired
accepted → archived
rejected → archived
```

Site visit transitions:

```txt id="site-visit-status-transitions"
requested → accepted
accepted → scheduled
scheduled → rescheduled
scheduled → completed
scheduled → no_show
requested → rejected
scheduled → cancelled
rescheduled → completed
any active → expired
```

Do not allow arbitrary status change by unauthorized user.

---

## 65. Manual Smoke Checks If App Runs

If app can run, check:

* guest contact CTA opens auth/setup-required

* wrong user cannot view proposal
* message thread participants only
* wrong user cannot read thread
* site visit request participant-only
* saved item save/unsave own only

Use if:

* messaging foundation works but realtime not implemented
* contact reveal foundation exists but actual reveal remains setup-required
* proposal foundation partial
* site visit foundation partial
* saved/recent items partial
* notification provider delivery setup-required
* message attachments setup-required
* RLS runtime tests pending
* responsive/browser checks pending
* admin oversight placeholder only

### `FAIL`

Use if:

* build fails
* hidden contact leaks
* public can read leads/messages
* wrong user can read lead/thread/proposal/site visit
* fake inquiry/contact reveal/message/proposal/site visit appears real
* unread count fake
* notification leaks contact
* private pages indexable/public cached
* service role/provider secret exposed
* DB changes missing migration
* RLS missing on private tables

### `BLOCKED`

Use if:

* Prompt 04 entity foundation failed
* Prompt 06 dashboards failed
* Prompt 07 admin foundation failed and admin oversight required
* Supabase/RLS unavailable blocks safe communication implementation
* auth/session unavailable
* package/build baseline broken
* architecture conflict needs owner decision

### `SETUP_REQUIRED`

Use for:

* notification provider missing
* email/SMS/WhatsApp provider missing
* media/R2 missing for attachments
* realtime provider missing
* calendar/reminder provider missing
* Supabase env missing

Setup-required is acceptable only if no fake functionality appears and privacy is protected.

## 80. Matching Manual Verification Reminder

After this implementation prompt, run:

```txt id="next-verification-prompt"
prompts/08_MANUAL_VERIFICATION_LEADS_CRM_REQUIREMENTS_PROPOSALS_MESSAGES.md
```

Do not start Prompt 09 until Prompt 08 verification passes or is explicitly accepted as `PARTIAL`, `BLOCKED` or `SETUP_REQUIRED`.

## 82. Quality Bar

This phase is successful when future phases can rely on:

* lead creation is real
* duplicate prevention works
* participants are protected
* contact remains hidden
* reveal requires authorization
* CRM stages are real
* proposals are participant-scoped
* messages are participant-scoped
* site visits are participant-scoped
* saved items are own-user only
* notification events do not leak contact
* RLS protects communication tables
* no fake communication data exists
* dashboards show real/no-data states
* docs accurately updated
* manual verification is ready
