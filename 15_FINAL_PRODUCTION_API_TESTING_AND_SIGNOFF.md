## 1. Prompt Identity

```txt id="prompt-identity"
Prompt File: prompts/15_FINAL_PRODUCTION_API_TESTING_AND_SIGNOFF.md
Prompt Number: 15
Phase: Final Production API Testing And Signoff
Type: Implementation / Final Readiness Prompt
Matching Verification Prompt: prompts/15_MANUAL_VERIFICATION_FINAL_PRODUCTION_API_TESTING_AND_SIGNOFF.md
Previous Verification Prompt: prompts/14_MANUAL_VERIFICATION_PERFORMANCE_CACHING_DEPLOYMENT_LAUNCH.md
```

---

## 2. Phase Purpose

The purpose of this phase is to prepare the final production-readiness package and verify that all provider/API integrations are either:

* actually configured and tested,
* honestly marked `SETUP_REQUIRED`,
* honestly marked `PARTIAL`,
* honestly marked `BLOCKED`, or
* intentionally disabled behind safe feature flags.

This phase should create/update:

* final API test checklist
* final provider test checklist
* final production/staging env checklist
* final smoke test matrix
* final launch freeze checklist
* final rollback checklist
* final fake data cleanup checklist
* final RLS/security checklist handoff
* final provider status table
* final known limitations list
* final Super Admin signoff package
* final manual verification handoff

This phase does not itself approve launch unless final manual verification also passes and Super Admin explicitly signs off.

This phase prepares final signoff. Matching manual verification performs final signoff review.

---

## 7. Hard Final Signoff Rules

Claude must enforce:

```txt id="hard-final-signoff-rules"
No fake production readiness.
No fake provider active status.
No fake payment success.
No fake OTP delivery.
No fake SMS delivery.
No fake WhatsApp delivery.
No fake email delivery.
No fake media/CDN success.
No fake monitoring.
No fake RLS pass.
No fake security pass.
No fake rollback tested status.
No fake Super Admin signoff.
No test/demo/mock mode in production.
No hidden contact leak.
No private route in sitemap.
No private data in public cache.
No service role in client.
No provider secret in client.
No final PASS without manual verification.
```

Forbidden:

* marking `ACTIVE` without real tested provider
* marking `PASS` from a skipped test
* using dev OTP bypass in production
* showing test payment success as real
* sending fake invoice/payment status
* hiding unresolved critical bugs
* ignoring setup-required provider items
* ignoring rollback gaps
* ignoring private data leaks
* ignoring failed build/typecheck/lint

---

## 8. Final Status Values

Use these final status values:

```txt id="final-status-values"
NOT_READY
READY_FOR_FINAL_VERIFICATION
READY_FOR_SUPER_ADMIN_REVIEW
PARTIAL_ACCEPTANCE_REQUIRED
BLOCKED
SETUP_REQUIRED
PRODUCTION_READY_AFTER_SIGNOFF
```

Rules:

* This implementation prompt can use `READY_FOR_FINAL_VERIFICATION` if all preparation/docs/checklists are ready.
* This prompt cannot use final `PRODUCTION_READY_AFTER_SIGNOFF` unless final manual verification and Super Admin signoff are already complete and documented.
* If provider/live checks are pending, use `SETUP_REQUIRED` or `PARTIAL_ACCEPTANCE_REQUIRED`.
* If critical issues exist, use `BLOCKED` or `NOT_READY`.

---

## 9. Final Provider Status Rules

Provider statuses must be accurate:

```txt id="provider-status-values"
NOT_STARTED
SETUP_REQUIRED
CONFIGURED
TEST_MODE
ACTIVE
PARTIAL
DEGRADED
FAILED
BLOCKED
DISABLED
```

Definitions:

* `NOT_STARTED`: no implementation/config yet.
* `SETUP_REQUIRED`: implementation/foundation exists but keys/config/testing missing.
* `CONFIGURED`: env/config present but live test not completed.
* `TEST_MODE`: sandbox/test provider working, not production.
* `ACTIVE`: production/live provider configured and tested successfully.
* `PARTIAL`: some provider functions work, others pending.
* `DEGRADED`: provider works with known issues.
* `FAILED`: provider test failed.
* `BLOCKED`: provider cannot proceed due to blocker.
* `DISABLED`: intentionally off behind feature flag.

Do not mark `ACTIVE` without real successful provider test.

```txt id="fake-mock-demo-patterns"
mock
fake
demo
sample
dummy
test user
test property
test project
test payment
test invoice
test notification
test ad
test provider
lorem ipsum
placeholder count
hardcoded count
fake analytics
fake views
fake leads
fake RERA
fake verified
fake review
```

Rules:

* dev/test fixtures allowed only in test/dev paths.
* production UI must not show fake data as real.
* fake counts forbidden.
* fake payment success forbidden.
* fake provider delivery forbidden.
* fake verified/RERA forbidden.
* seed/demo data guarded from production.

```txt id="required-checks"
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm test
```

or package manager equivalent.

If available, also run:

```txt id="optional-final-checks"
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:security
npm run test:rls
npm run test:performance
npm run analyze
npm run lighthouse
npm audit
pnpm audit
```

If scripts missing, document `NOT_CONFIGURED`.

If commands fail, fix safe issues if in scope or mark `BLOCKED`/`NOT_READY`.

Do not fake command results.

## 71. Final Manual Smoke Checks If App Runs

If app can run, perform or prepare exact final smoke checks.

Minimum:

* home loads
* search loads
* property detail loads
* project detail loads
* login/register popup works
* public hidden contact absent
* owner dashboard loads
* broker dashboard loads
* builder dashboard loads
* admin login loads
* admin dashboard loads
* wrong role denied
* private direct URL denied
* media public images load
* private signed URL denied to wrong user
* payment checkout status correct
* notifications load
* provider status accurate
* public ad status correct
* sitemap/robots safe
* no private page in sitemap
* no private public cache
* build passes

Document exact results.

Full verification happens in matching manual prompt.

## 72. Production Readiness Decision Rules

Use these rules.

### `READY_FOR_FINAL_VERIFICATION`

Use when:

* Prompt 15 readiness package created/updated
* final checklists prepared
* provider statuses honest
* build/checks run or documented
* no known critical blocker from implementation pass
* final manual verification pending
* Super Admin signoff pending

### `READY_FOR_SUPER_ADMIN_REVIEW`

Use only if:

* final manual verification already passed
* all critical checks passed
* no launch blockers
* provider statuses acceptable
* known limitations documented
* Super Admin approval still pending

Usually not used by implementation prompt alone.

### `PRODUCTION_READY_AFTER_SIGNOFF`

Use only if:

* final manual verification passed
* Super Admin explicitly approved
* launch blockers closed
* provider statuses accepted
* rollback/backup accepted
* final signoff documented

Do not invent this status.

### `PARTIAL_ACCEPTANCE_REQUIRED`

Use if:

* some providers setup-required
* some non-critical checks unavailable
* load test missing
* external audit missing
* monitoring provider missing
* browser matrix incomplete
* legal review pending
* user/Super Admin must accept risk before launch

### `SETUP_REQUIRED`

Use if:

* required credentials missing
* production env missing
* provider setup missing
* hosting missing
* staging missing
* test data/admin users unavailable
* final provider tests cannot run

### `BLOCKED`

Use if:

* build fails
* critical security/privacy issue exists
* hidden contact leak
* fake provider/payment/OTP success
* RLS missing
* private cache/sitemap issue
* rollback missing
* provider secret leak
* service role client exposure
* payment webhook unsafe
* Super Admin signoff impossible due to blockers

### `NOT_READY`

Use if:

* readiness package incomplete
* major docs missing
* test matrix missing
* launch blockers not classified

- reason:

Manual verification:
- pending prompts/15_MANUAL_VERIFICATION_FINAL_PRODUCTION_API_TESTING_AND_SIGNOFF.md

Next step:
- run prompts/15_MANUAL_VERIFICATION_FINAL_PRODUCTION_API_TESTING_AND_SIGNOFF.md
```

Do not say only “done”.

Do not claim production ready unless final verification and explicit Super Admin signoff are complete.

## 74. Matching Manual Verification Reminder

After this implementation prompt, run:

```txt id="next-verification-prompt"
prompts/15_MANUAL_VERIFICATION_FINAL_PRODUCTION_API_TESTING_AND_SIGNOFF.md
```

This is the final manual verification prompt.

No further prompt phase should start after Prompt 15 verification.
