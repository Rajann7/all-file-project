# My Gujarat Property — Prompt 10 Manual Verification: Media Storage, Uploads, R2 And CDN

This prompt is for Claude Code.

Use this prompt immediately after completing:

```txt id="matching-implementation-prompt"
prompts/10_MEDIA_STORAGE_UPLOADS_R2_CDN.md
```

This prompt verifies the **Media Storage, Uploads, R2 And CDN** phase.

Do not skip this verification.

Do not start Prompt 11 until this verification is complete or the project owner/Super Admin explicitly accepts a documented `PARTIAL`, `BLOCKED` or `SETUP_REQUIRED` state.

Do not mark PASS without real media provider, upload, file validation, RLS, signed URL, public/private access, secret masking, responsive and docs checks.

Do not fake PASS.

This verification checks:

* Cloudflare R2 provider foundation
* CDN/public URL foundation
* public/private bucket strategy
* storage credentials safety
* upload sessions
* signed upload URLs
* signed download URLs
* server-side validation
* property image uploads
* project image uploads
* project video upload foundation
* project brochure PDF upload
* project floor plan upload
* property brochure role rules
* profile/avatar/logo upload
* message attachment placeholder/foundation
* verification/admin document placeholder/foundation
* media metadata tables
* media variants
* entity media links
* processing job foundation
* media audit logs
* cover image
* reorder
* delete/soft delete
* restore foundation
* orphan cleanup foundation
* CDN purge/cache foundation
* image conversion status
* WebP/AVIF status
* HEIC/HEIF handling
* EXIF stripping
* SVG safety
* PDF validation
* video validation
* malware scan placeholder/foundation
* public search/detail media integration
* dashboard media manager integration
* admin media status integration
* RLS policies
* public/private media access separation
* wrong-user media denial
* hidden contact metadata protection
* provider secret masking
* no service role client exposure
* no fake upload success
* no fake CDN
* no fake conversion
* no fake malware scan
* responsive upload/gallery UI
* docs updates
* Prompt 11 readiness

This phase does not verify final production media load testing, final CDN tuning, full video transcoding, full malware scanning provider, full Cloudflare Images, full AI moderation, full ad banner workflow, or final legal/content moderation signoff. Those are later or external operational checks.

```

Record exact changed files.

---

## 7. Migration Verification

If Prompt 10 changed database schema, verify migration exists.

Expected pattern:

```txt id="expected-migration"
supabase/migrations/*_media_storage_uploads_r2_cdn.sql
```

Verify migration includes:

* purpose
* phase: Prompt 10
* tables created/changed
* views created/changed
* RLS policies created/changed
* indexes created
* functions/triggers if any
* unique cover constraints if any
* upload cleanup status fields
* media visibility/status fields
* destructive changes yes/no
* backup required yes/no
* rollback notes

If DB changed without migration:

* create critical bug
* mark verification `FAIL`
* do not start Prompt 11

If migration exists without rollback notes:

* create bug
* mark `PARTIAL` or `FAIL` depending data/media risk

If DB not changed because Supabase/env unavailable:

* mark DB/RLS runtime checks `SETUP_REQUIRED`
* do not claim RLS PASS

---

## 8. Expected Table Verification

If schema exists, check for implemented or reused tables.

Possible tables:

```txt id="expected-media-tables"
upload_sessions
media_assets
media_variants
entity_media_links
media_processing_jobs
media_audit_logs
media_moderation_events
media_cleanup_jobs
```

Minimum safe foundation should include:

* upload session tracking or safe alternative
* media asset metadata
* entity media linking
* visibility/status fields
* owner/profile/entity reference
* deleted/soft-delete fields
* RLS enabled
* indexes for owner/entity/status queries
* cleanup/orphan tracking if upload flow creates temporary objects

If implementation claims media complete but no metadata/RLS model exists:

* create bug
* mark `FAIL` or `PARTIAL`

---

## 9. Provider Configuration Verification

Verify media provider configuration.

Expected possible env vars:

```txt id="r2-env"
R2_ACCOUNT_ID
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
R2_BUCKET_PUBLIC
R2_BUCKET_PRIVATE
R2_ENDPOINT
R2_PUBLIC_CDN_URL
R2_REGION
R2_SIGNED_URL_TTL_SECONDS
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN
CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID
CLOUDFLARE_CACHE_PURGE_ENABLED
```

Check:

* R2 secrets server-only
* Cloudflare API token server-only
* public CDN URL safe to expose
* missing provider shows `R2_SETUP_REQUIRED`
* upload UI disabled or setup-required when provider missing
* API provider status updated
* no fake provider active
* no fake CDN active

If R2 secret appears in client bundle/UI:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 10. Provider Choice Verification

If implementation uses Cloudflare R2:

* verify R2 client is server-side
* verify signed URL flow or server upload flow
* verify bucket/key strategy
* verify CDN URL helper
* verify provider setup states

If implementation uses Supabase Storage temporarily:

* verify docs clearly say R2 is `SETUP_REQUIRED` or `DEFERRED`
* verify same private/public media rules apply
* verify no claim of R2 active
* verify provider status honest

If implementation claims R2 active without code/config/test evidence:

* create bug
* mark `PARTIAL` or `FAIL`

---

## 11. Public / Private Bucket Strategy Verification

Verify bucket strategy.

Public bucket should contain only:

* approved public images
* public optimized variants
* public thumbnails
* public profile logos/avatars if public-safe

Private bucket should contain:

* originals
* draft media
* pending media
* rejected media
* brochures before approval
* floor plans before approval
* videos before approval
* verification documents
* admin documents
* message attachments
* private profile images before publish

Check:

* originals private
* private docs never public
* message attachments private
* draft/pending media private
* public variants only when entity/media ready
* public CDN does not expose private bucket files
* no bucket policy makes everything public

If private bucket/object is publicly reachable:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 12. Object Key Verification

Verify object keys are safe.

Rules:

* no phone/email/WhatsApp in object key
* no raw filename without sanitization
* no exact private address in path
* no personal document number in path
* UUID/media ID used
* environment namespace used if possible
* extension normalized

* no hidden contact in CDN URL

If object key includes hidden contact/phone/email:

* create bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 13. Upload Session Verification

Verify upload session flow.

failed
cancelled
expired
deleted
```

Check:

* session created server-side
* auth required
* role/entity ownership checked before URL issued
* media category allowlisted
* session expires
* upload completion verified server-side
* wrong user cannot complete another session

* object key generated server-side
* file size constraints enforced or verified after upload
* upload completion requires server verification
* wrong user denied
* expired URL handled safely

If signed URL generation returns secret credentials:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 15. Signed Download URL Verification

Verify signed download URL for private media:

If wrong user can get signed URL:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 16. Upload Completion Verification

Verify upload completion:

* checks session ownership
* verifies object exists in storage
* verifies object size/type where possible
* creates media asset record only after real upload
* starts validation/processing honestly
* links media to correct entity only after permission check
* returns safe status
* no fake success if object missing
* no public visibility until ready/public allowed
* handles provider failure safely

If complete upload returns success without real object verification:

* create bug
* mark `FAIL` or `PARTIAL`

---

## 17. Server Upload Endpoint Verification

If using server upload endpoint instead of signed URL:

* image/PDF/video processing statuses are honest
* upload/gallery UI is usable on mobile
* CDN/cache/cleanup foundations are documented
* no fake media behavior exists
* docs reflect reality
* Prompt 11 can build location/search/SEO/CMS/legal features using safe real media
