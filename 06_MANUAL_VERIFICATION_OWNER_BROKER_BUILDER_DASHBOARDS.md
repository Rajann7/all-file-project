# My Gujarat Property — Prompt 06 Manual Verification: Owner, Broker And Builder Dashboards

This prompt is for Claude Code.

Use this prompt immediately after completing:

```txt id="matching-implementation-prompt"
prompts/06_OWNER_BROKER_BUILDER_DASHBOARDS.md
```

This prompt verifies the **Owner, Broker and Builder Dashboard** phase.

Do not skip this verification.

Do not start Prompt 07 until this verification is complete or the project owner/Super Admin explicitly accepts a documented `PARTIAL`, `BLOCKED` or `SETUP_REQUIRED` state.

Do not mark PASS without real role access, own-data-only, dashboard UI, fake-data, security, responsive and docs checks.

Do not fake PASS.

## 2. Verification Purpose

The purpose of this verification phase is to confirm that authenticated public-user dashboards are secure, role-aware, usable and honest.

This verification checks:

* shared dashboard shell
* `/dashboard` role redirect
* Owner dashboard
* Broker dashboard
* Builder dashboard
* role-specific navigation
* direct URL denial
* guest denial
* wrong-role denial
* own-data-only dashboard queries
* entity management routes
* profile/settings foundation
* notification foundation
* billing placeholder/foundation
* verification placeholder/foundation
* support/help foundation
* leads/CRM placeholders
* builder ads placeholders
* builder agents/team placeholders
* public profile links
* no fake dashboard stats
* no fake leads
* no fake notifications
* no fake billing/payment
* no fake verification
* no hidden contact leak
* no wrong-user data leak
* no public admin link
* no public footer inside dashboard
* no private dashboard public cache risk
* responsive dashboard layout
* build/lint/typecheck/tests
* docs updates
* Prompt 07 readiness

This phase does not verify full admin/staff system, CRM, billing, ads, notifications, support tickets, verification workflow or media upload. Those are later prompts.

* no fake sponsored placement
* no fake payment
* project selection not fake
* RERA note/disclaimer safe
* setup-required/coming later if not implemented

If fake ad metrics appear:

* create bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 33. Public Profile Link Verification

Verify broker/builder dashboard public profile links:

* link exists only if slug/profile safe
* route works or shows setup/profile incomplete
* public page does not expose private mobile/email
* no fake verified badge
* no fake listing/project count
* owner dashboard does not create public owner profile unless approved

If public profile link leaks private profile data:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 34. Navigation Verification

Check role-specific nav.

Owner nav should not include builder-only modules.

Broker nav should not include builder-only modules.

Builder nav should not include owner/broker posting modules.

All nav items must be:

* implemented
* safe placeholder
* disabled with reason
* or hidden

No dead nav.

No `href="#"`.

No admin/staff links.

If `href="#"` exists in dashboard nav:

* create bug
* mark `PARTIAL`

---

## 35. Dashboard Footer Separation Verification

Verify:

* public footer is hidden on dashboard pages
* public footer is hidden on admin/internal pages
* dashboard uses dashboard shell
* dashboard does not show public homepage footer links
* no public admin link through footer
* no duplicated public layout causing UX clutter

If public footer appears but does not leak or break, mark `PARTIAL`; if it exposes admin/security issues, mark `FAIL`.

---

## 36. Hidden Contact Verification

Dashboards must not leak hidden contact except where user owns their own data and field is intended.

Check:

* overview cards
* entity lists
* profile menu

* public profile links
* support placeholders
* logs/errors
* client payloads

Do not expose:

* other users’ phone/email
* contact reveal phone/email
* lead contact details before lead/contact phase
* hidden listing contact publicly
* private profile mobile/email to wrong user

If hidden contact leaks to wrong user/public dashboard:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 37. Private Cache Verification

Dashboard pages are private.

Verify:

* no public caching of dashboard pages
* no static generation of private dashboard data
* no cached private props shared between users
* `no-store` or equivalent used where needed
* user-specific data not revalidated publicly
* auth/session checked server-side
* private data not in public sitemap

If private dashboard data can be cached publicly:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 38. Service Role / Secret Verification

Search dashboard code for:

```txt id="secret-patterns"
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
OTP_API_KEY
SMS_API_KEY
WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_TOKEN

RESEND_API_KEY
```

Verify:

* no service role in client components
* no provider secrets in dashboard UI
* no raw env values shown
* no secrets in docs beyond placeholders

* recommend secret rotation without printing value

---

## 39. RLS Verification For New Tables

If Prompt 06 created new tables, verify:

```txt id="possible-new-tables"
dashboard_preferences
saved_items
recently_viewed_items
notification_preferences
user_settings
profile_completion_events
```

For each private table:

* RLS enabled
* user can read/write own rows only
* wrong user denied
* public denied
* indexes added
* no public-safe view unless intentional
* migration exists
* rollback notes exist

If RLS missing:

* create critical bug

---

## 40. Migration Verification

If Prompt 06 changed DB, verify migration exists:

```txt id="migration-name"
supabase/migrations/*_owner_broker_builder_dashboards.sql
```

Migration must include:

* purpose
* phase: Prompt 06
* tables/views/indexes changed
* RLS policies changed
* destructive changes yes/no
* backup required yes/no
* rollback notes

If DB changed without migration:

* create critical bug

* focus visible
* keyboard navigation through nav/action menus
* drawers/modals focus behavior safe
* forms have labels
* destructive confirmations clear
* error messages readable
* tap targets large

If severe blocker exists:

* create bug
* mark `PARTIAL` or `FAIL`

---

## 45. Build / Lint / Typecheck Verification

Run available checks.

Examples:

npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm test
```

```txt id="pnpm-checks"
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

If scripts missing:

* record `NOT_CONFIGURED`

If checks fail:

* fix safe issues if in scope
* create bug if unresolved
* mark `FAIL` or `PARTIAL`

Build failure blocks PASS.

* leads/CRM placeholders only
* builder ads/agents placeholders only
* some responsive/browser checks pending
* RLS runtime tests unavailable but route/data logic reviewed

Prompt 07 can start only if user/Super Admin accepts partial and no critical access/privacy/security issue exists.

### FAIL

Use `FAIL` if:

* build fails
* guest can access dashboard
* wrong role can access dashboard
* wrong-user data visible
* hidden contact leaks
* fake stats/leads/billing/verification shown as real
* public admin link visible

* DB changes missing migration
* dead primary dashboard nav breaks core use

Do not start Prompt 07.

### BLOCKED

Use `BLOCKED` if:

* Prompt 02 auth/role foundation failed
* Prompt 04 entity foundation failed and dashboards depend on it
* Prompt 05 public profile dependencies block dashboard links
* cannot inspect required files
* package/build baseline broken

* Supabase/env unavailable
* notifications provider missing
* billing/payment provider missing
* media provider missing
* support/email provider missing
* analytics provider missing

---

## 64. If Verification Fails

If verification fails:

1. do not start Prompt 07
2. create/update bug entries
3. update `MANUAL_VERIFICATION.md`
4. update `SECURITY_RLS_CHECKLIST.md`
5. update `PERFORMANCE_CHECKLIST.md`
6. update `DEPLOYMENT_ROLLBACK.md`
7. update `brain.md`
8. state exact blocker
9. fix if safe and in scope
10. rerun verification
11. only then proceed

Critical access/privacy/security failures block progress.

---

## 65. If Verification Is Partial

If verification is partial:

* document exact partial items
* list setup-required providers
* list placeholder modules
* list untested role/runtime checks
* list responsive/browser gaps
* confirm no guest access
* confirm no wrong-role access
* confirm no wrong-user data leak
* confirm no hidden contact leak
* confirm no fake data shown as real
* update docs
* ask/require owner acceptance before Prompt 07 if risk is significant

Acceptable partial examples:

* billing placeholder only
* notification placeholder only
* leads/CRM placeholder only
* ads/agents placeholder only
* support ticket system not implemented
* some browser checks not done
* missing test users but code inspected

Not acceptable partial without fix:

* guest dashboard access
* wrong-role dashboard access

* implement admin/staff system
* implement full leads/CRM
* implement full billing/payment
* implement full ads/promotions
* implement full notifications
* implement full support tickets

* add fake stats to make dashboard look full
* add fake leads
* add fake notifications
* add fake invoices
* add fake verified badges
* bypass role guards
* expose hidden contact
* expose provider secrets
* ignore private cache risk
* ignore direct URL bypass
* start Prompt 07 after FAIL/BLOCKED

---

## 68. Quality Bar

This verification is successful when future phases can trust that:

* dashboards are private
* dashboards are role-specific
* Owner/Broker/Builder access is correct
* all dashboard data is own-data-only
* all unfinished modules are honest placeholders/setup-required states
* dashboard overview uses real data only
* no fake stats/leads/billing/verification exist
* no hidden contact leaks
* no public admin links exist
* no public footer appears in dashboard
* private caching is safe
* dashboard UI works on mobile
* docs reflect reality
* Prompt 07 admin system can be built separately and safely
