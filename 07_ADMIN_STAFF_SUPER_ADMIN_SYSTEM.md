---

## 7. Hard Admin Separation Rules

Claude must enforce:

```txt id="hard-admin-separation-rules"
Public users cannot access admin routes.
Owner/Broker/Builder cannot become staff/admin from public UI.
Admin/staff cannot register from public frontend.
Admin/staff login is separate.
Admin/staff login is not mobile OTP.
Admin/staff routes are noindex.
Admin/staff links are hidden from public UI.
Admin/staff permissions are server-side.
```

Forbidden:

* public admin register route
* admin mobile OTP login
* admin link in public header/footer
* public dashboard admin link
* public user role escalation to admin
* staff self-grant permission
* client-only admin protection
* exposed provider secrets
* fake staff users
* fake Super Admin

---

## 8. Internal User Types

Internal roles:

```txt id="internal-user-types"
super_admin
admin
staff
```

Functional staff roles:

```txt id="functional-staff-roles"
verification_manager
support_manager
content_manager
seo_manager
ads_manager
billing_manager
payment_manager
city_manager
user_manager
notification_manager
system_manager
security_manager
reports_manager
audit_manager
```

Staff statuses:

```txt id="staff-statuses"
invited
active
disabled
suspended
deleted
```

Rules:

* Super Admin can manage everything.
* Admin can manage operations but not sensitive provider/security/system actions unless explicitly permitted.
* Staff can only access modules assigned.
* Staff cannot self-grant permissions.
* Disabled/suspended staff cannot access admin.
* Deleted staff remains audit-retained, not normal hard delete.

---

## 9. Permission Model Requirements

Use a granular permission model.

Permission dimensions:

```txt id="permission-actions"
read
create
update
approve
reject
delete
export
bulk_action
view_sensitive
manage_provider
manage_security
manage_payment
manage_staff
manage_feature_flags
manage_system
```

Permission modules:

```txt id="permission-modules"
users
staff
properties
projects
requirements
verification
support
reports
fraud
billing
payments
plans
coupons
trials
ads
notifications
providers
settings
feature_flags
cms
blog
legal
seo
locations
audit_logs
system_health
security
exports
```

Rules:

* permission checks must be server-side
* UI hiding is not enough
* high-risk modules require explicit permission
* provider/security/system actions should be Super Admin only unless explicitly granted
* export/sensitive/private-doc access requires explicit permission
* public users have no internal permissions

entity_moderation_notes
entity_status_events
admin_internal_notes

builder → /admin
staff without permission → /admin/providers
staff without permission → /admin/staff
staff without permission → /admin/billing

Must not:

* statically generate private admin data

## 69. Phase Completion Status Rules

### `DONE`

Use when implementation completed but manual verification pending.

### `PASS`

Do not use from implementation prompt alone unless manual verification also completed and documented.

### `PARTIAL`

Use if:

* admin shell works but some modules are placeholders
* billing/provider/support/CMS modules setup-required
* maker-checker foundation partial
* audit foundation partial
* staff invite email provider setup-required
* RLS runtime tests pending
* responsive/browser checks pending
* non-critical admin filters/export deferred

### `FAIL`

Use if:

* build fails
* public user can access admin
* public admin registration exists
* admin mobile OTP allowed
* provider secret exposed
* service role client exposure
* staff can self-grant permission
* wrong staff permission grants access
* approval action without permission
* hidden contact/private docs leak
* admin page public cached/indexable
* DB changes missing migration
* RLS missing on admin private tables

### `BLOCKED`

Use if:

* Prompt 02 admin auth foundation failed
* auth/session unavailable blocks admin implementation
* Supabase/RLS unavailable blocks secure admin tables
* package/build baseline broken
* architecture conflict needs owner decision
* cannot inspect required files

### `SETUP_REQUIRED`

Use for:

* admin auth provider missing
* email provider missing for staff invites
* Supabase env missing
* payment/Razorpay missing
* media/R2 missing
* notification provider missing
* support provider missing
* monitoring/analytics missing

Setup-required is acceptable only if UI is honest and no fake functionality appears.
