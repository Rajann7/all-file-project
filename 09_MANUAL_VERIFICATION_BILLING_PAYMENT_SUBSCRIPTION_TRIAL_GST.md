# My Gujarat Property — Prompt 09 Manual Verification: Billing, Payment, Subscription, Trial And GST

This prompt is for Claude Code.

Use this prompt immediately after completing:

```txt id="matching-implementation-prompt"
prompts/09_BILLING_PAYMENT_SUBSCRIPTION_TRIAL_GST.md
```

This prompt verifies the **Billing, Payment, Subscription, Trial and GST** phase.

Do not skip this verification.

Do not start Prompt 10 until this verification is complete or the project owner/Super Admin explicitly accepts a documented `PARTIAL`, `BLOCKED` or `SETUP_REQUIRED` state.

Do not mark PASS without real payment security, webhook, subscription, invoice, GST, RLS, private cache, provider secret and docs checks.

Do not fake PASS.

## 2. Verification Purpose

The purpose of this verification phase is to confirm that billing and payment behavior is secure, honest, role-scoped and provider-safe.

This verification checks:

* pricing page
* role-wise plans
* plan features
* plan limits
* subscriptions
* subscription lifecycle
* posting gates
* usage counters
* checkout order creation
* payment attempts
* Razorpay provider setup
* Razorpay webhook endpoint
* webhook signature verification
* webhook idempotency
* client callback safety
* payment records
* reconciliation foundation
* invoices
* invoice numbering
* GST profile
* GST breakdown
* trials
* coupons
* add-ons
* refunds
* credit notes
* cancellation/downgrade/grace foundation
* billing dashboards
* admin billing controls
* billing permissions
* billing audit logs
* RLS policies
* wrong-user billing denial
* provider secret masking
* private noindex/no-store
* no fake payment
* no fake active plan
* no fake invoice
* no fake GST
* no fake refund
* responsive billing UI
* docs updates
* Prompt 10 readiness

This phase does not verify final production Razorpay go-live, GST filing, accounting integrations, bank reconciliation integrations, automated refund settlement, media billing enforcement, ads billing lifecycle, or final production payment signoff. Those are later or external operational checks.

Record exact changed files.

---

## 7. Migration Verification

If Prompt 09 changed database schema, verify migration exists.

Expected pattern:

```txt id="expected-migration"
supabase/migrations/*_billing_payment_subscription_trial_gst.sql
```

Verify migration includes:

* purpose
* phase: Prompt 09
* tables created/changed
* views created/changed
* RLS policies created/changed
* indexes created
* invoice sequence/function if any
* webhook idempotency constraints
* unique constraints
* destructive changes yes/no
* backup required yes/no
* rollback notes

If DB changed without migration:

* create critical bug
* mark verification `FAIL`
* do not start Prompt 10

If migration exists without rollback notes:

* create bug
* mark `PARTIAL` or `FAIL` depending data/payment risk

If DB not changed because Supabase/env unavailable:

* mark DB/RLS runtime checks `SETUP_REQUIRED`
* do not claim RLS PASS

---

## 8. Expected Table Verification

If schema exists, check for implemented or reused tables.

Possible tables:

```txt id="expected-billing-tables"
plans
plan_features
plan_limits
subscriptions
subscription_events
usage_counters
payment_orders
payment_attempts
payments
payment_webhook_events
invoices
invoice_line_items
gst_profiles
coupons
coupon_redemptions
trials
trial_redemptions
add_ons
add_on_purchases
refunds
credit_notes
billing_audit_logs
```

Minimum safe foundation should include:

* plan/catalog storage or safe config
* subscription records
* payment order/attempt records if checkout implemented
* webhook event records if webhook implemented
* invoice records if invoice implemented
* RLS enabled on private tables
* indexes for profile/status/provider references
* unique/idempotency constraints where needed

If implementation claims billing complete but storage/RLS is missing:

* create bug
* mark `FAIL` or `PARTIAL`

---

## 9. Pricing Page Verification

Verify pricing page:

* loads safely
* shows role-wise plans
* distinguishes Owner/Broker/Builder plans
* shows real configured plans or setup-required state
* shows features/limits honestly
* shows GST/tax note
* shows login required for checkout when guest
* shows checkout disabled/setup-required if provider missing
* does not show fake final prices unless product owner provided them
* does not show fake discounts
* does not show fake active plan
* mobile responsive
* no dead CTA
* no `href="#"`

If pricing page shows fake active discount/plan as real:

* create bug
* mark `PARTIAL` or `FAIL`

---

## 10. Plan Catalog Verification

Verify plan catalog:

* role field exists:

  * owner
  * broker
  * builder
* plan code/name exists
* price/currency INR exists
* billing cycle exists
* active/inactive status exists
* feature list exists
* limits exist
* display order exists
* public visibility intentional
* admin/internal fields not public
* no inactive/internal plan public unless intended
* no fake unlimited claim unless enforced

If features are shown as included but not enforced and not documented partial:

* create bug
* mark `PARTIAL`

---

## 11. Role-Wise Plan Verification

Verify:

### Owner

* Owner plans control property/requirement posting.
* Owner cannot buy/use builder project plan as Owner without role change/approval.
* Owner does not get project posting.

### Broker

* Broker plans control property/requirement posting and CRM/lead limits if implemented.
* Broker cannot buy/use builder project plan without role change/approval.
* Broker does not get project posting.

### Builder

* Builder plans control project posting and builder-specific limits.
* Builder does not get normal property posting.
* Builder does not get owner/broker requirement posting unless product explicitly later approves.

If role plan allows forbidden role features:

* create bug
* mark `FAIL` if it creates access bypass

---

## 12. Subscription Model Verification

Verify subscription records include:

* profile/user link
* role
* plan ID
* status
* billing cycle
* start date
* current period start/end
* trial/grace fields if used
* cancelled/expired fields
* provider reference if payment-backed
* created/updated timestamps

Subscription statuses:

```txt id="subscription-statuses"
none
trialing
active
past_due
grace
cancelled
expired
paused
downgraded
payment_failed
pending_activation
admin_granted
```

Check:

* expired/cancelled not treated active
* pending_activation not treated active
* only verified payment/approved trial/admin grant activates
* admin_granted audited
* one current active/trial/grace subscription per profile/role unless explicitly documented

If inactive subscription grants access:

* create bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 13. Subscription Lifecycle Verification

Verify lifecycle transitions:

```txt id="subscription-lifecycle-checks"
none → trialing
none → pending_activation
pending_activation → active
trialing → active
trialing → expired
active → past_due
past_due → grace
grace → active
grace → expired
active → cancelled
active → downgraded
active → paused
cancelled → expired
```

Rules:

* transitions validated server-side
* invalid transitions denied
* payment_failed does not activate plan
* trial expiry behavior documented
* grace expiry behavior documented
* subscription events recorded if implemented
* no fake lifecycle status

If arbitrary client can set subscription active:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 14. Plan Gate Helper Verification

Verify plan gate helper:

* server-side
* role-aware
* feature-aware
* checks subscription status
* checks trial/grace/admin_granted if allowed
* checks usage counter
* checks account status where applicable
* returns safe typed denial reason
* does not trust client plan state
* does not fake pass when billing setup missing
* works for owner/broker/builder

If plan gate only exists in UI and backend allows bypass:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 15. Posting Gate Verification

Verify posting gates for:

* property create/submit
* project create/submit
* requirement create/submit

Expected:

* guest denied
* wrong role denied from previous prompts
* no active/trial/grace subscription triggers pricing/setup-required
* active plan with limit allows action
* exceeded limit denies action
* usage counters update server-side
* no fake remaining quota
* no client-only gate
* direct API/action bypass denied

If posting gate is claimed active but can be bypassed by server action:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

If posting gate intentionally remains partial until billing provider configured:

* document exact status
* ensure no fake pass claim

---

## 16. Usage Counter Verification

Verify usage counters:

* profile/subscription scoped
* feature key scoped
* period scoped if applicable
* updated server-side
* not client-manipulable
* race-condition safe where possible
* reset behavior documented
* active listing counts real
* contact unlock usage real if integrated
* no fake remaining quota

If user can manipulate usage counter from client:

* create bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 17. Checkout Order Verification

Verify checkout order creation:

* requires auth
* validates role
* validates plan active
* validates plan belongs to user role
* validates price server-side
* validates currency INR
* applies coupon server-side
* creates payment order/attempt
* does not activate subscription
* handles provider missing as setup-required
* returns only safe client fields
* does not expose key secret/webhook secret

If checkout trusts client price:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 18. Razorpay Provider Setup Verification

If Razorpay implemented, verify env usage:

```txt id="razorpay-env"
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET
RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET
```

Check:

* key secret server-only
* webhook secret server-only
* public/client only receives key ID if needed
* missing keys show `RAZORPAY_SETUP_REQUIRED`
* test/live mode documented
* no fake production payment
* provider status in `API_PROVIDER_STATUS.md` honest
* provider errors safe

If key secret exposed to client:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 19. Client Callback Verification

Verify Razorpay/client callback behavior:

* records checkout attempt only if needed
* does not activate subscription
* does not mark invoice paid
* does not generate invoice
* does not mark payment verified
* shows pending/processing state until webhook verification
* handles failure/cancel safely
* duplicate callback idempotent/safe

If client callback activates plan:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 20. Webhook Endpoint Verification

Verify webhook endpoint:

* route exists if payment provider implemented
* receives raw body if required by Razorpay signature verification
* verifies signature using webhook secret
* validates event type
* validates local order/payment references
* validates amount
* validates currency INR
* stores webhook event record
* enforces idempotency
* updates payment/order in transaction where possible
* activates subscription/add-on only after verified event
* generates invoice only after verified event
* handles duplicate webhook safely
* returns safe status
* does not leak secrets/errors

If webhook accepts unverified payload:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 21. Webhook Signature Verification

Verify:

* invalid signature rejected
* missing signature rejected
* wrong secret rejected
* raw body used correctly
* verification failure does not mutate payment/subscription
* failure logged safely
* no secret printed

If signature verification is missing:

* add-on activation if applicable

Test/inspect duplicate webhook behavior:

* no duplicate invoice
* no duplicate subscription event
* no duplicate add-on purchase
* no double usage/coupon redemption
* second event returns safe duplicate status

If duplicate webhook duplicates invoice/subscription:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

---

## 23. Webhook Event Type Verification

Verify supported events are documented.

Possible events:

payment.failed
order.paid
refund.created
refund.processed
refund.failed
subscription.activated
subscription.charged
subscription.cancelled
subscription.completed
subscription.halted
```

Check:

* unsupported events safely ignored/logged
* no fake handling claim
* one-time order flow events match actual implementation
* subscription provider events deferred if not implemented

invoices
invoice_line_items
gst_profiles
coupon_redemptions
trials
trial_redemptions
add_on_purchases
refunds
credit_notes
billing_audit_logs
```

Plan/coupon/add-on public visibility must be intentional and safe.

If RLS missing on private billing table:

* create critical bug
* mark `FAIL`

If database unavailable:

* mark RLS runtime verification `SETUP_REQUIRED`

2. User A select User A subscription → allowed.
3. User A select User B subscription → denied.
4. User A select User A invoices → allowed.
5. User A select User B invoices → denied.
6. User A select User A payments → allowed or safe projection.
7. User A select User B payments → denied.
8. User A update own payment status → denied.
9. User A activate own subscription directly → denied.
10. Staff without billing.read select billing admin data → denied.
11. Staff with billing.read select permitted billing data → allowed.
12. Staff without refunds.manage approve refund → denied.
13. Public select public active plans → allowed if intended.
14. Public select internal inactive plans/admin fields → denied.

## 53. Posting Gate Smoke Verification

Test or inspect gates.

Scenarios:

```txt id="posting-gate-tests"

Owner without active plan creates/submits property → pricing/setup-required or denied if gate active
Owner with active allowed plan creates/submits property → allowed
Owner exceeding property limit → denied
Broker without active plan creates/submits property → pricing/setup-required or denied if gate active
Broker exceeding requirement limit → denied
Builder without active plan creates/submits project → pricing/setup-required or denied if gate active
Builder exceeding project limit → denied
Builder tries property → denied by role
Owner/Broker tries project → denied by role

pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

If scripts missing:

* record `NOT_CONFIGURED`

If checks fail:

* fix safe issues if in scope
* create bug if unresolved
* mark `FAIL` or `PARTIAL`

Build failure blocks PASS.

---

## 62. Webhook Test Suggestions

If safe local/staging provider testing is possible, test:

```txt id="webhook-test-scenarios"
1. Valid Razorpay webhook with captured payment → payment verified.
2. Invalid signature webhook → rejected/no mutation.
3. Duplicate valid webhook → no duplicate invoice/subscription.
4. Amount mismatch webhook → manual_review/no activation.
5. Currency mismatch webhook → manual_review/no activation.
6. Unknown order webhook → ignored/manual_review/no activation.
7. Failed payment webhook → no subscription activation.
8. Client callback without webhook → no active subscription.
```

If real provider keys/webhook secret missing:

* mark Razorpay runtime tests `SETUP_REQUIRED`
* do not mark webhook PASS

---

## 63. Manual Smoke Test Matrix

If app can run and safe test environment exists, test:

```txt id="manual-smoke-matrix"
Pricing:
- /pricing loads
- role-wise plans visible
- features/limits honest
- guest checkout requires login

User billing:
- user billing dashboard requires auth
- user sees own subscription/payment/invoice only
- wrong user invoice URL denied
- GST profile own-user only
- invoice download setup/works safely

Checkout:
- missing provider keys show setup-required
- create order validates role/plan/price
- client callback does not activate subscription
- invalid webhook rejected
- duplicate webhook idempotent
- verified webhook activates subscription only in test/configured environment

Gates:
- no-plan posting denied/setup
- active plan posting allowed within limits
- over-limit posting denied

Admin:
- billing admin permission-scoped
- payment/refund actions permission-scoped
- provider secrets masked
- no fake revenue/payment
```

If safe test environment is unavailable:

* inspect code
* mark runtime payment tests `SETUP_REQUIRED`
* do not fake runtime PASS

## 74. Verification Result Decision

Use these rules.

### PASS

Mark `PASS` only if:

* build passes
* pricing page safe
* plan catalog role-wise and honest
* subscriptions role-scoped
* subscription activation requires verified webhook/trial/admin grant
* client callback alone cannot activate subscription
* webhook signature verification exists and is tested/confirmed
* webhook idempotency exists
* duplicate webhook does not duplicate invoice/subscription
* server-side price validation exists
* invoice generated only after verified payment/admin event
* invoice numbering unique
* GST profile private
* wrong user billing access denied
* private billing pages noindex/no-store
* provider secrets not exposed
* plan/posting gates server-side if claimed active
* admin billing permission-scoped
* no fake payment/plan/invoice/GST/refund data
* RLS enabled/tested or honestly setup-required with no unsafe claim
* responsive checks completed
* docs updated
* no blocking bugs

### PARTIAL

Use `PARTIAL` if:

* plan/subscription foundation exists but Razorpay setup-required
* webhook endpoint exists but runtime provider test unavailable
* invoice PDF setup-required
* email invoice delivery setup-required
* refund provider setup-required
* add-ons partial
* trial/coupon foundation partial
* usage counters partial
* posting gate partially integrated
* RLS runtime tests unavailable but policies/migration reviewed
* responsive/browser checks incomplete
* no fake payment/invoice/GST and no secret/billing leak exists

Prompt 10 can start only if user/Super Admin accepts partial and no critical payment/security/privacy issue exists.

### FAIL

Use `FAIL` if:

* build fails
* fake payment success shown
* subscription activates from client callback only
* webhook signature missing
* invalid webhook mutates billing data
* duplicate webhook duplicates invoice/subscription
* provider secret exposed
* service role client exposure
* wrong user can view billing/invoice/payment
* client-side price trusted
* plan/posting gate bypass exists while claimed active
* fake active plan/invoice/GST/refund appears real
* private billing page public/indexable/cached
* RLS missing on private billing tables
* DB changes missing migration

Do not start Prompt 10.

### BLOCKED

Use `BLOCKED` if:

* Prompt 04 entity foundation failed and posting gates depend on it
* Prompt 06 dashboards failed and billing UI depends on it
* Prompt 07 admin foundation failed and admin billing depends on it
* Supabase/RLS unavailable blocks safe billing verification
* raw body webhook handling impossible without framework setup
* cannot inspect required files
* package/build baseline broken
* architecture conflict needs owner decision

### SETUP_REQUIRED

Use `SETUP_REQUIRED` for:

* Razorpay keys missing
* Razorpay webhook secret missing
* email provider missing
* PDF generation missing
* GST validation provider missing
* cron/expiry jobs missing
* Supabase env missing
* safe payment test environment missing

Setup-required is acceptable only when no fake billing/payment functionality appears and all sensitive data remains protected.

## 78. If Verification Fails

If verification fails:

1. do not start Prompt 10
2. create/update bug entries
3. update `MANUAL_VERIFICATION.md`
4. update `SECURITY_RLS_CHECKLIST.md`
5. update `PERFORMANCE_CHECKLIST.md`
6. update `DEPLOYMENT_ROLLBACK.md`
7. update `API_PROVIDER_STATUS.md` if provider/payment issue found
8. update `brain.md`
9. state exact blocker
10. fix if safe and in scope
11. rerun verification
12. only then proceed

Critical payment/security/privacy failures block progress.

---

## 79. If Verification Is Partial

If verification is partial:

* document exact partial items
* list setup-required providers
* list untested webhook/payment checks
* list RLS runtime gaps
* list invoice/PDF/email gaps
* list posting gate gaps
* list responsive/browser gaps
* confirm no fake payment success
* confirm client callback does not activate subscription
* confirm no provider secret leak
* confirm no wrong-user billing access
* confirm no fake invoice/GST/refund
* confirm private pages noindex/cache safe
* update docs
* ask/require owner acceptance before Prompt 10 if risk is significant

Acceptable partial examples:

* Razorpay keys missing but checkout disabled/setup-required
* webhook runtime test unavailable but signature code reviewed
* invoice PDF setup-required
* email invoice delivery setup-required
* refund provider setup-required
* GST validation provider not implemented
* cron/expiry job setup-required
* posting gate partially integrated but documented

* fake payment success
* subscription activation from client callback
* missing webhook signature verification
* provider secret leak
* wrong-user billing access
* fake invoice/GST/refund
* private billing page public cached/indexable

## 80. If Verification Passes

If verification passes:

* update `MANUAL_VERIFICATION.md` with PASS
* update `FEATURE_REGISTRY.md`
* update `CHANGELOG.md`

* final response should say Prompt 10 can start

Do not start Prompt 10 automatically unless user asked to continue.

---

## 81. What Not To Do In This Verification

Do not:

* use real money unless explicitly configured and approved
* fake payment success to test UI
* mark subscription active manually unless admin-grant flow is authorized/audited
* bypass webhook verification
* disable webhook signature checks
* expose Razorpay secrets
* trust client price
* create fake invoices
* create fake GST verification
* create fake refunds
* add fake active plans
* bypass RLS
* expose wrong-user billing data
* index private billing pages
* cache private billing data publicly
* start Prompt 10 after FAIL/BLOCKED

---

## 82. Quality Bar

This verification is successful when future phases can trust that:

* pricing is honest
* plan roles are correct
* subscription state is secure
* posting gates are server-side where claimed active
* payment success requires verified webhook
* client callback cannot activate plan
* webhook signature verification exists
* webhook idempotency prevents duplicate invoices/subscriptions
* invoices are generated only after verified/admin events
* invoice numbers are unique
* GST profile and billing data are private
* admin billing is permission-scoped
* provider secrets are protected
* private billing pages are noindex/no-store
* no fake payment/plan/invoice/GST/refund exists
* docs reflect reality
* Prompt 10 media storage can safely build on plan/media limits
