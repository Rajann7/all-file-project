---

## 7. Hard Media Safety Rules

Claude must enforce:

```txt id="hard-media-rules"
No fake upload success.
No fake CDN URL.
No private file public URL.
No hidden contact in public media metadata.
No service role in client.
No unrestricted upload endpoint.
No frontend-only file validation.
No public access to original/private files.
No SVG execution risk.
No PDF public leak.
No video fake processing.
No orphan file accumulation without tracking.
No RLS bypass.
```

Forbidden:

* direct client upload using server secrets
* public write bucket
* public read of private/original/verification docs
* fake WebP/AVIF conversion status
* fake malware scan success
* fake upload progress
* fake thumbnail generation
* fake CDN purge success
* hidden contact in filenames/alt text/EXIF
* file type validation by extension only

---

## 8. Provider Configuration

Recommended provider: Cloudflare R2 with CDN/custom domain.

Environment variables may include:

```txt id="r2-env"
R2_ACCOUNT_ID
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
R2_BUCKET_PUBLIC
R2_BUCKET_PRIVATE
R2_ENDPOINT
R2_PUBLIC_CDN_URL
R2_REGION
R2_SIGNED_URL_TTL_SECONDS
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN
CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID
CLOUDFLARE_CACHE_PURGE_ENABLED
```

Rules:

* R2 secret access key server-only
* API token server-only
* public CDN URL can be public
* missing env shows `R2_SETUP_REQUIRED`
* upload UI disabled/setup-required if provider missing
* no fake provider active
* update `API_PROVIDER_STATUS.md`

If using Supabase Storage instead of R2 temporarily:

* document provider choice
* keep same security/privacy rules
* mark R2 as `SETUP_REQUIRED` or `DEFERRED`
* do not claim Cloudflare R2 active

---

## 9. Storage Bucket Strategy

Recommended buckets:

```txt id="bucket-strategy"
Public bucket:
- published entity images
- public optimized variants
- public thumbnails
- public profile logos/avatars if user opted public

Private bucket:
- originals
- pending listing media
- draft listing media
- brochures before approval
- floor plans before approval
- project videos before approval
- verification documents
- admin documents
- message attachments
- private profile images before publish
```

Rules:

* original backup private
* public variants generated only after safety checks
* pending/draft media private
* approved/published entity public media can be public/CDN
* deleted/paused/private entity media should not be public unless intentionally retained and inaccessible from public UI
* private bucket access via signed URL only

---

## 10. Object Key Strategy

Use safe object keys.

Example:

```txt id="object-key-strategy"
media/{environment}/{entity_type}/{entity_id}/{media_id}/original/{safe_filename}
media/{environment}/{entity_type}/{entity_id}/{media_id}/variants/{variant_name}.{ext}
private/{environment}/{profile_id}/{media_id}/original/{safe_filename}
```

Rules:

* never include phone/email in object key
* never include raw user filename directly without sanitization
* use UUID/media ID
* keep extension normalized
* avoid predictable sensitive paths for private docs
* include environment namespace
* avoid PII in URL
* avoid exact address in path

---

## 11. File Type Rules

Allowed image formats:

```txt id="image-formats"
JPG
JPEG
PNG
WebP
AVIF
GIF
HEIC
HEIF
SVG only if sanitized or rasterized safely
```

Allowed PDF:

```txt id="pdf-formats"
PDF
```

Allowed video formats:

```txt id="video-formats"
MP4
WebM
MOV
M4V
```

Rules:

* validate MIME and magic bytes where possible
* extension-only validation is not enough
* SVG is high-risk; sanitize, rasterize or disable with clear setup-required
* HEIC/HEIF may require conversion provider/library; otherwise setup-required
* GIF can be large; enforce size/dimension limits
* reject executable/script files
* reject polyglot files where detectable
* reject dangerous PDFs if scanner unavailable and private handling required

---

## 12. Size And Dimension Rules

Use configurable limits.

Do not invent final business limits as hard product truth unless already configured.

Suggested defaults can be placeholders:

```txt id="suggested-limits"
image_max_size_mb: configurable
pdf_max_size_mb: configurable
video_max_size_mb: configurable
profile_image_max_size_mb: configurable
max_image_width_px: configurable
max_image_height_px: configurable
thumbnail_widths: 320, 640, 960, 1280
quality_webp: configurable
quality_avif: configurable
```

Rules:

* limits must be enforced server-side
* UI shows limits
* plan limits may override
* no “unlimited” unless safe
* rejected files show clear error
* huge files do not crash app

User product requirement says no arbitrary min/max should be forced visually as product restriction unless needed for safety/provider/plan; keep limits configurable and documented.

* do not mark complete
* create bug
* mark result `FAIL`

---

## 56. SQL Migration Rule

If DB changes are needed, create migration:

```txt id="migration-name"

* RLS policies created/changed
* indexes created
* functions/triggers if any

## 84. Phase Completion Status Rules

### `DONE`

Use when implementation completed but manual verification pending.

### `PASS`

Do not use from implementation prompt alone unless manual verification also completed and documented.

### `PARTIAL`

Use if:

* R2 provider setup-required but upload UI safely disabled
* signed URLs foundation exists but provider runtime test unavailable
* image conversion partial
* AVIF/HEIC conversion setup-required
* malware scan setup-required
* video transcoding setup-required
* PDF preview setup-required
* cleanup cron setup-required
* CDN purge setup-required
* message attachments placeholder only

* responsive/browser checks pending

### `FAIL`

Use if:

* build fails
* fake upload success
* provider secret exposed
* service role client exposure
* private media public
* hidden contact leaks through media metadata
* wrong user media access
* upload endpoint unrestricted
* unsafe SVG public rendering
* file validation missing
* project video max-one rule bypass
* media RLS missing
* DB changes missing migration
* public pages show private/pending media

### `BLOCKED`

Use if:

* Prompt 04 entity foundation failed
* Prompt 05 detail/search media integration impossible
* Prompt 06 dashboards failed and upload UI depends on it
* Prompt 09 plan gates failed and media limits depend on it
* storage provider choice unresolved
* Supabase/RLS unavailable blocks safe media tables
* package/build baseline broken
* architecture conflict needs owner decision

### `SETUP_REQUIRED`

Use for:

* R2 credentials missing
* CDN URL missing
* Cloudflare API token missing
* image processing library missing
* AVIF/HEIC conversion missing
* malware scanner missing
* video transcoder missing
* PDF preview generator missing
