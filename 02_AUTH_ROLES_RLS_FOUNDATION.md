## 5. Implementation Scope

This phase may implement:

### 5.1 Public User Auth Foundation

* public mobile OTP login/register UI foundation
* OTP provider setup-required handling
* auth popup/bottom sheet integration foundation
* login/register intent preservation
* account lookup by mobile
* registration flow fields:

  * full name

  * role:

    * Owner
    * Broker
    * Builder
* role-specific profile creation
* post-login redirect/continue action
* logout
* session state
* hide login/register after login

### 5.2 Public Roles

Implement public role baseline:

* Owner
* Broker/Agent
* Builder/Developer

Each role should have:

* profile record
* role permissions baseline
* dashboard route foundation
* protected route guards
* account status
* verification status placeholder
* plan/subscription gate placeholder

### 5.3 Admin/Staff Auth Foundation

* email/Google auth architecture if supported
* no mobile OTP admin login
* no public admin registration
* invite-only staff model baseline
* staff account table/profile
* staff roles/permissions baseline
* admin route guards
* admin noindex metadata where possible
* staff disabled/suspended checks

### 5.4 RLS Foundation

Implement database foundation with RLS:

* public profiles/private profiles separation
* own-profile read/update policies
* role profile tables
* staff profiles and permissions tables
* public-safe views if needed
* RLS enabled for private tables
* admin/staff permission foundation
* service role only trusted server-side

---

## 6. Out Of Scope For This Phase

Do not implement full:

* property posting
* project posting
* requirement posting
* lead/CRM system
* messages
* site visits
* billing/payment
* Razorpay checkout
* media upload/R2/CDN
* ads/promotions
* notification delivery
* Google Maps
* WhatsApp API
* CMS/blog/legal full system
* advanced analytics
* full admin modules
* full dashboard modules
* complete verification workflow
* complete subscription system

This phase only creates auth, roles, profile and RLS foundation.

Later prompts expand the modules.

---

## 7. Hard Security Rules

Claude must follow:

1. Never expose `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to client.
2. Never disable RLS to make code work.
3. Never create frontend-only route protection.
4. Never rely only on hidden buttons.
5. Never create public admin registration.
6. Never allow mobile OTP admin login.
7. Never fake OTP sent.
8. Never fake login success.
9. Never fake role/verification status.
10. Never mark RLS PASS without policies/tests.
11. Never return hidden contact publicly.
12. Never expose provider secrets.
13. Never store OTP in logs.
14. Never show raw auth/provider errors to users.
15. Never allow wrong user profile access.
16. Never allow wrong role dashboard access.
17. Never allow public access to admin route.
18. Never use test/demo user as production real user.

---

## 8. Public Auth UX Rules

Public auth should use popup/bottom sheet behavior.

Auth popup opens when:

* guest clicks login/register
* guest clicks contact/inquiry
* guest clicks save
* guest clicks post property
* guest clicks post requirement
* guest clicks dashboard protected route
* guest tries protected action

Flow:

1. user enters mobile number
2. system checks whether account exists
3. if account exists:

   * send OTP
   * verify OTP
   * login
4. if mobile not registered:

   * show registration form
   * collect full name/email/mobile/role
   * send OTP
   * verify OTP
   * create auth user/profile
   * create role profile
   * login
5. continue original intent
6. hide login/register links

If OTP provider is not configured:

* show `OTP_PROVIDER_SETUP_REQUIRED`
* do not fake OTP sent
* allow dev-only safe mock only if clearly dev-only and never production
* update `API_PROVIDER_STATUS.md`

## 33. Auth Provider Handling

Supabase Auth is expected foundation.

OTP provider may be:

* Supabase phone OTP
* external SMS provider
* setup-required
* dev-only mock if explicitly local/dev and safe

Rules:

* production cannot use mock OTP
* OTP provider missing must show setup-required
* no fake OTP sent
* OTP errors safe
* OTP attempts rate-limited where possible
* OTP not logged
* mobile verified only after actual verification

If provider not configured, implement UI/status foundation and mark setup-required.

---

## 34. Admin Auth Provider Handling

Admin/staff login may use:

* Supabase email/password
* Supabase OAuth Google
* future SSO
* setup-required

Rules:

* admin/staff login separate route
* no public create account
* staff account must exist/invite accepted
* public users cannot become staff from public UI
* no mobile OTP admin login
* admin login route noindex
* provider missing shows setup-required

---

## 35. Route Guard Requirements

Implement route guards for:

### Public routes

* homepage allowed
* search allowed later
* public listing/project pages later
* login/register popup accessible
* pricing/legal/support public later

### Auth required routes

* dashboard
* post property later
* post requirement later
* profile settings
* saved items later
* notifications later
* billing later

### Role-specific routes

* owner dashboard only owner
* broker dashboard only broker
* builder dashboard only builder

### Internal routes

* admin/staff only
* public roles denied
* guest denied
* noindex

Route guard must be server-side or middleware-backed where needed.

Client-only redirect is not enough.

---

## 36. Suggested Route Structure

Create only if needed and in scope.

Possible routes:

```txt id="auth-route-structure"
/login
/register
/auth/callback
/dashboard
/dashboard/owner
/dashboard/broker
/dashboard/builder
/profile
/admin/login
/admin
/unauthorized
/setup-required
```

If existing route structure differs, align safely.

Do not create full dashboard modules yet.

Dashboards may show foundation placeholder with real role/access checks and setup/coming-soon states.

No fake dashboard stats.

---

## 37. Auth Components

Possible components:

```txt id="auth-components"
AuthPopup
MobileOtpForm
RegisterRoleForm
RoleSelector
AuthProviderStatusNotice
LogoutButton
ProtectedActionButton
UnauthorizedState
SetupRequiredState
```

Rules:

* mobile-friendly
* loading state
* error state
* setup-required state
* no fake OTP
* preserve intent
* no admin registration
* disabled reason visible

---

## 38. Session Helpers

Implement safe helpers if needed:

```txt id="session-helper-examples"
getCurrentUser()
getCurrentProfile()
requireAuth()
requireRole(role)
requireAnyRole(roles)
requireStaff()
requireStaffPermission(module, action)
isPublicRole(role)
isInternalRole(role)
```

Rules:

* server-side checks for sensitive actions
* safe errors
* no service role in client
* no hidden contact leak
* consistent status handling

---

## 39. Permission Helpers

Implement or plan helpers:

```txt id="permission-helper-examples"
canAccessOwnerDashboard(profile)
canAccessBrokerDashboard(profile)
canAccessBuilderDashboard(profile)
canAccessAdmin(staff)
canManageStaff(staff)
canViewSensitiveDocs(staff)
```

Full permission implementation can be expanded later.

Foundation should prevent public/wrong role access now.

---

## 40. Middleware Rules

If using middleware:

* avoid redirect loops
* keep public routes accessible
* protect dashboard/admin routes
* role checks may require server-side validation if middleware cannot read DB safely
* admin route must not be public
* login route should redirect authenticated users appropriately
* setup-required route public-safe
* no service role in middleware client-side context unless server-only and safe

Middleware is not a replacement for RLS.

---

## 41. Account Creation Flow

When registration succeeds:

1. create auth user or verify OTP via provider
2. create `profiles` record
3. create matching role profile:

   * `owner_profiles`
   * `broker_profiles`
   * `builder_profiles`
4. record Terms/Privacy consent if captured
5. record audit event
6. redirect to intended route/dashboard
7. show success only after DB success

If DB profile creation fails:

* do not show full success
* handle rollback/retry safely
* log safe error
* create bug if inconsistent profile created

---

## 42. Existing User Login Flow

When mobile exists:

1. send OTP
2. verify OTP
3. fetch profile
4. check account status
5. fetch role profile
6. set session
7. redirect to intended route
8. show dashboard/action

If profile missing:

* repair if safe
* or show support/setup error
* record bug
* do not fake profile

---

## 43. Logout Flow

Logout must:

* end session
* clear auth UI state
* redirect to public-safe page
* remove private dashboard data from client state
* keep selected city if stored public preference
* not clear unrelated user preferences unless intended

---

## 44. Unauthorized UX

Unauthorized page/state should handle:

* guest needs login
* wrong role
* suspended account
* banned account
* staff permission missing
* admin route denied
* provider setup-required

Messages must be safe and not reveal private data.

Examples:

```txt id="unauthorized-messages"
Login required.
This dashboard is not available for your role.
Your account is currently restricted. Contact support.
You do not have permission to access this admin module.
Authentication provider setup required.
```

---

## 45. UI Requirements For This Phase

UI must include:

* loading state
* empty/setup-required state
* safe error state
* mobile responsive auth popup/screen
* clear role selector
* disabled reason if OTP missing
* logout button where applicable
* no dead buttons
* no fake success
* no public admin link

Check baseline at:

* 320px
* 360px
* 390px
* 430px

Full responsive audit later, but auth UI must not be unusable.

---

## 46. Legal/Consent Requirements

Registration/auth must include or prepare:

* Terms acceptance
* Privacy acceptance
* OTP/data notice
* marketing opt-in optional
* contact sharing consent later during inquiry/contact reveal

If legal pages not implemented yet:

* link to placeholder/setup-required legal routes only if routes exist
* otherwise display policy text and mark CMS/legal route `NOT_STARTED`
* do not use dead links
* update docs

No fake legal guarantee.

---

## 47. Audit Requirements

Record safe audit events for:

* registration
* login
* logout where applicable
* OTP requested
* OTP verified
* profile created
* role selected
* admin login attempt
* admin access denied
* account blocked

Do not log:

* OTP code
* secrets
* provider tokens
* full raw errors with sensitive data
* hidden contact beyond safe masked format

If audit event table not implemented, document `PARTIAL`.

---

## 48. Rate Limit Requirements

Add or prepare rate limiting for:

* OTP request
* OTP verify
* login attempts
* registration attempts
* admin login attempts
* staff invite acceptance

If rate limiting infra not implemented yet:

* document as `PARTIAL` or `NOT_STARTED`
* add safe provider-level reliance note if applicable
* create feature registry item
* do not mark auth security full PASS

---

## 49. Provider Setup-Required UX

If OTP/admin provider missing:

Show safe setup-required state.

Example:

```txt id="otp-setup-required-message"
OTP service is not configured yet. Please contact the site administrator.
```

Internal admin/provider page may show:

```txt id="provider-internal-message"
OTP_PROVIDER_SETUP_REQUIRED: Configure OTP provider environment variables and test delivery before production.
```

Public users should not see raw env names unless internal/admin context.

---

## 50. API / Server Action Rules

Any auth/profile server action must:

* validate input
* check provider status
* check rate limits if available
* use server-side Supabase client
* use service role only if needed and server-only
* handle errors safely
* create/update DB only after validation
* return typed safe result
* not return secrets
* not return private data unnecessarily

---

## 51. Input Validation Rules

Validate:

* full name length
* email format
* mobile format
* role value
* OTP length/format
* consent accepted where required
* admin email format
* staff invite token format
* redirect/return URL safety

Invalid input returns safe validation error.

Do not trust client validation only.

---

## 52. Redirect Safety Rules

Auth redirect/intent must be safe.

Rules:

* allow internal paths only
* block external redirect URLs unless explicitly approved
* prevent open redirect
* preserve protected action intent safely
* after login redirect based on role
* wrong role redirect to own dashboard or unauthorized

---

## 53. Dashboard Placeholder Rules

This phase may create basic dashboard landing pages.

Allowed:

* role-specific dashboard shell placeholder
* real profile info
* real account status
* setup-required/coming-soon module cards
* logout/profile controls

Not allowed:

* fake stats
* fake leads
* fake properties
* fake projects
* fake payments
* fake notifications
* fake analytics

If module not implemented, show:

* “Coming in later phase”
* “Setup required”
* “No data yet”

---

## 54. Admin Placeholder Rules

This phase may create basic admin landing/login.

Allowed:

* admin login route
* setup-required state
* staff auth guard
* simple admin shell placeholder after real staff auth
* noindex metadata

Not allowed:

* public admin registration
* fake admin login
* fake staff user
* fake provider status
* fake admin stats
* provider secrets visible

---

## 55. `.env.example` Updates

Update `.env.example` if needed.

Ensure placeholders for auth:

```txt id="auth-env-placeholders"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
OTP_PROVIDER=
OTP_API_KEY=
SMS_PROVIDER=
SMS_API_KEY=
ADMIN_AUTH_PROVIDER=

* Prompt 02 implementation status
* changed files
* migration files
* auth/provider setup-required status
* RLS status

  * `prompts/02_MANUAL_VERIFICATION_AUTH_ROLES_RLS_FOUNDATION.md`
* exact resume instruction

Example:

```txt id="brain-next-step"
Next step: Run prompts/02_MANUAL_VERIFICATION_AUTH_ROLES_RLS_FOUNDATION.md before starting Prompt 03.
```

---

## 65. Required Tests / Checks

Run available:

```txt id="test-commands"
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm test
```

or equivalent package manager commands.

Additionally, if possible:

* run migration validation

* run route guard tests if available

If command missing, document `NOT_CONFIGURED`.

If command fails, fix if safe or document bug.

Do not claim checks passed if not run.

---

## 66. Auth Manual Smoke Checks To Perform If Possible

If app can run locally, test manually:

* guest sees login/register
* guest can open auth popup
* OTP missing shows setup-required
* registration form shows Owner/Broker/Builder
* invalid role rejected
* authenticated user hides login/register
* logout works
* owner route denied to broker/builder
* broker route denied to owner/builder
* builder route denied to owner/broker
* guest denied dashboard
* public denied admin
* admin login separate
* admin registration absent
* no public admin link

Record results in docs.

Full verification happens in matching manual prompt.

---

## 67. RLS Manual Smoke Checks To Perform If Possible

If Supabase/database is available, verify:

* RLS enabled on new private tables
* user can read own profile
* user cannot read another private profile
* user can update own safe fields
* user cannot update role directly if not allowed
* public cannot read private profile table
* public-safe view excludes email/mobile
* staff table not public
* staff permissions not public
* user consent own-only
* audit events not public
* wrong role denied route/server action

If DB unavailable, mark `SETUP_REQUIRED`.

Do not mark RLS PASS without actual checks.

---

## 68. Rollback Guidance

Provide rollback notes for:

* migration rollback
* route guard rollback
* auth component rollback
* provider setup rollback
* env placeholder rollback
* docs rollback

If migration created:

* document whether dropping tables is destructive
* recommend backup before production
* avoid destructive rollback if data exists
* feature flag/disable routes if needed

---

### `PASS`

Do not use from implementation prompt alone unless manual verification has also been completed in same run and documented.

### `PARTIAL`

Use if:

* provider missing but UI/setup-required done
* DB/RLS unavailable but schema planned
* some checks not configured
* non-critical route guards pending
* manual verification pending

### `BLOCKED`

Use if:

* Supabase setup required before any safe implementation
* package/build broken from baseline
* architecture conflict prevents safe auth implementation
* missing required prompt/docs
* package install impossible

### `SETUP_REQUIRED`

Use if:

* OTP provider missing
