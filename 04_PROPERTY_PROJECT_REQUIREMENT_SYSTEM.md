city_or_village
area
locality
society
building
landmark
address
pin_code
latitude

Invalid data should not be saved as submitted/published.

---

## 25. Status Transition Rules

Allowed transitions:

```txt id="status-transitions"
draft → submitted
submitted → under_review
under_review → need_changes
under_review → approved
under_review → rejected
need_changes → submitted
approved → published
published → paused
paused → published
published → expired
published → deleted
draft → deleted
rejected → deleted
```

Rules:

* normal user can create draft
* normal user can submit own draft
* normal user can edit own draft
* editing published/approved item should create approval-needed state or mark pending review
* normal user cannot approve own item

## 26. Approval Workflow Foundation

For each entity:

* user creates draft
* user submits
* status becomes submitted/pending
* item not public until approved
* admin/staff later reviews
* need changes stores reason
* rejected stores reason
* approved/published stores timestamp/staff later
* edit after approval triggers review if significant
* pause/resume allowed without reapproval
* delete soft-deletes

Full admin UI in Prompt 07.

This phase may create admin moderation queue placeholders/fields.

---

## 27. Slug Rules

Slug rules:

* unique per entity type
* generated from title/project name
* safe characters only
* avoid exposing private data
* collision handled
* stable after publish if possible
* changing slug later creates redirect in SEO phase
* draft can have temporary slug

Do not include phone/email/private address in slug.

---

## 28. Public-Safe Views

Create public-safe views for published entities.

Possible views:

```txt id="public-safe-views"
public_properties_view
public_projects_view
public_requirements_view
```

Public-safe views must include only approved/published safe fields.

Exclude:

* contact phone
* contact email
* hidden address details
* private owner profile fields
* draft/pending/rejected/paused/deleted items
* admin notes
* rejection reasons
* private media
* billing/plan data
* internal moderation fields
* exact private location if hidden
* private documents

If requirements are not intended fully public, use scoped public-safe view or no public view.

---

## 29. RLS Requirements

RLS must enforce:

### Properties

* owner/broker can create own property
* builder cannot create property
* user can read/update own property
* public can read only published public-safe view
* wrong user cannot update/delete
* admin/staff moderation later permission-scoped
* deleted/private rows hidden

### Projects

* builder can create own project
* owner/broker cannot create project
* builder can read/update own project
* public can read only published public-safe view
* wrong builder cannot update/delete
* admin/staff moderation later permission-scoped

### Requirements

* owner/broker can create own requirement
* builder cannot create requirement unless explicitly allowed later
* user can read/update own requirement
* public/scoped view only approved safe data
* wrong user cannot update/delete
* matching access later role-scoped

### Supporting Tables

* project units scoped to builder/project owner
* media metadata scoped to owner/entity
* moderation notes private
* RLS enabled on private tables

Frontend checks are not security.

---

## 30. Permission Helper Requirements

Add/update helpers:

```txt id="permission-helper-requirements"
canCreateProperty(profile)
canCreateProject(profile)
canCreateRequirement(profile)
canEditProperty(profile, property)
canEditProject(profile, project)
canEditRequirement(profile, requirement)
canSubmitForApproval(profile, entity)

canSoftDelete(profile, entity)
```

Rules:

* server-side use required
* helpers must match docs
* invalid role denied
* direct URL/API bypass denied

---

## 31. Routes To Implement Or Prepare

Use existing route conventions.

Possible routes:

```txt id="entity-routes"
dashboard/properties
dashboard/properties/new
dashboard/properties/[id]/edit
dashboard/projects
dashboard/projects/new
dashboard/projects/[id]/edit
dashboard/requirements
dashboard/requirements/new
dashboard/requirements/[id]/edit
```

Role-specific route alternatives are fine:

```txt id="role-specific-routes"
dashboard/owner/properties
dashboard/broker/properties
dashboard/builder/projects
dashboard/owner/requirements
dashboard/broker/requirements
```

Rules:

* guest denied
* wrong role denied
* builder property routes denied
* owner/broker project routes denied
* forms mobile-friendly
* placeholder dashboard routes safe if full dashboard later

---

## 32. Server Actions / API Routes

Implement safe server functions for:

* create property draft
* update property draft
* submit property
* pause/resume property
* soft delete property
* create project draft
* update project draft
* submit project
* pause/resume project
* soft delete project
* create requirement draft
* update requirement draft
* submit requirement
* pause/resume requirement
* soft delete requirement

Each must:

* require auth
* check role
* validate input
* check ownership
* check status transition
* use server-side DB access
* return safe typed errors
* not expose private data
* audit if audit table exists
* update timestamps

---

## 33. Subscription/Billing Gate Placeholder

Later billing phase requires active plan before posting.

For this phase:

* create plan gate hook/helper placeholder if useful
* do not implement Razorpay
* if no subscription system, mark posting gate `PARTIAL` or `SETUP_REQUIRED`
* show disabled/upgrade placeholder only if product wants gate visible
* do not fake active plan
* do not fake payment success

If product requires plan before posting immediately, implement safe placeholder:

* check plan helper returns setup-required/not implemented
* allow dev/admin override only if documented
* do not block core schema if billing not ready unless user requires

---

## 34. Verification Gate Placeholder

Verification may be required for certain actions later.

For this phase:

* include verification status fields
* do not fake verified
* do not show verified badge
* do not block all creation unless product requires
* document verification gate later
* RERA gate later for promotion/ads

---

## 35. RERA Foundation Rules

For projects:

* RERA registered yes/no
* RERA number field
* RERA status
* RERA valid until
* disclaimer flag
* RERA proof media later private
* RERA required for promotion/ads later if applicable

Rules:

* no fake RERA status
* no fake verified RERA badge
* no public proof document
* user should verify official RERA independently
* admin verification later

---

## 36. Media Placeholder Rules

Media system comes later, but forms may show placeholders.

Allowed:

* media section UI saying upload will be configured in media phase
* local file input disabled/setup-required if storage not ready
* media metadata fields if needed
* cover image placeholder if no upload

Not allowed:

* fake uploaded images
* fake brochure link
* fake video upload
* fake R2/CDN URL
* private file public URL
* project multiple videos beyond one-video rule

If media upload already exists, enforce:

* type validation
* ownership
* project one-video max
* private/public storage rules
* no fake success

---

## 37. Location Placeholder Rules

Location system full hierarchy later Prompt 11.

This phase should:

* collect basic location fields
* use existing city/locality data if available
* validate required location fields
* not fake map
* not fake nearby
* not fake IP location
* not require maps API
* keep data model ready for hierarchy

If location backend missing:

* use text/select foundation
* mark location hierarchy `PARTIAL`
* update docs

---

## 38. Dashboard Management Foundation

Entity management pages should show real own data only.

Allowed:

* “My Properties”
* “My Projects”
* “My Requirements”
* draft/pending/published status

* empty state

Not allowed:

* fake counts
* fake analytics

* fake views
* fake approval
* wrong-user items
* hidden contact leak

If dashboard shell not complete, use safe foundation pages.

---

## 39. Public Detail/Search Dependency

Do not build full public detail/search in this phase.

However:

* public-safe views should support later search/detail
* slugs should be ready
* statuses should be ready
* no private fields in public-safe view
* `/search` may still show placeholder until Prompt 05
* detail pages may be placeholder or not created

Do not show public unpublished items.

---

## 40. Admin Moderation Dependency

Do not build full admin moderation UI unless already present.

But schema should support:

* approval status
* submitted timestamp
* review note
* need changes reason
* rejection reason
* approved by staff ID later
* approved timestamp
* moderation audit later

Admin moderation implemented in Prompt 07.

---

## 41. Audit Event Requirements

If audit foundation exists, log:

* property created

* project updated
* project submitted
* project paused/resumed
* project deleted
* requirement created

* allow wrong owner update
* publish without approval
* show fake approval
* show fake verification

---

## 43. Input Sanitization

Sanitize and validate text fields:

* title
* description
* address
* landmark
* building name
* business details
* amenities/custom fields
* admin notes if any

Prevent:

* unsafe HTML
* script injection
* malicious URLs
* contact info placed in public fields if product wants contact hidden
* spammy content where possible

If contact details in description are not allowed, validate or flag for moderation.

---

Use safe errors:

```txt id="safe-errors"
AUTH_REQUIRED

* form fields stack
* buttons tappable
* stepper usable
* dropdowns not clipped

* owner can insert property
* owner can insert requirement
* owner cannot insert project
* broker can insert property

```

or package manager equivalent.

If available, also run:

* migration validation

If script missing, document `NOT_CONFIGURED`.

If check fails, fix or log bug.

Do not mark PASS from implementation prompt alone.

---

## 54. Manual Smoke Checks If App Runs

If app can run, check:

* guest cannot access new forms
* owner can access property form
* owner can access requirement form
* owner denied project form
* broker can access property form
* broker can access requirement form
* broker denied project form
* builder can access project form
* builder denied property form
* builder denied requirement form
* form validation works
* save draft works if implemented
* submit for approval works if implemented
* own list shows own drafts only

* no hidden contact public

Record results.

Full verification in matching manual prompt.

## 67. Phase Completion Status Rules

### `DONE`

Use when implementation completed but manual verification pending.

### `PASS`

Do not use from implementation prompt alone unless manual verification also completed and documented.

### `PARTIAL`

Use if:

### `BLOCKED`

Use if:

* Prompt 02 auth/RLS foundation failed
* Supabase setup prevents all meaningful DB work
* architecture conflict needs owner decision
* cannot inspect current code
* package/build baseline broken

### `SETUP_REQUIRED`
