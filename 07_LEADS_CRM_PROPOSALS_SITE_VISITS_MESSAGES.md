No fake message is allowed.

No fake proposal status is allowed.

No fake site visit is allowed.

No hidden contact leak is allowed.

## 2. Core Principles

The communication system must follow these principles:

1. Leads must be created from real user actions only.
2. Lead counts must be real.
3. Contact reveal must not happen for guests.
4. Hidden contact must never leak before authorization.
5. Inquiry success must only show after DB write succeeds.
6. Duplicate inquiry/contact reveal must be handled safely.
7. CRM data belongs to relevant participants only.
8. Messages belong to thread participants only.
9. Proposal status must be real.
10. Site visit status must be real.
11. Notifications must be DB-backed and real.
12. External notification delivery depends on provider status.
13. Dashboard analytics must not be fake.
14. Admin/staff access must be permission-scoped.
15. Every sensitive action must be server-authorized.
16. RLS must protect private communication data.
17. Rate limits must protect inquiry/message/contact reveal.
18. Reports/blocking must protect users from abuse.
19. No frontend-only privacy is allowed.
20. Manual verification is required before PASS.

---

## 9. Lead Creation Flow

Standard lead creation flow:

1. User performs lead-generating action.
2. Server checks login/auth.
3. Server checks role/account status.
4. Server checks target entity status.
5. Server checks contact/inquiry permission.
6. Server checks duplicate rules.
7. Server checks rate limits.
8. Server validates input.
9. Server creates or reuses lead.
10. Server logs lead event.
11. Server creates notification.
12. External notification queued if provider configured.
13. UI shows success/duplicate/existing state.
14. Dashboard updates with real data.

Failure cases:

* guest → auth popup
* wrong role → role restriction
* inactive/suspended account → blocked
* target not public/available → unavailable
* duplicate → existing lead state
* rate limited → safe rate-limit error
* provider missing → in-app lead still created if DB succeeds; external delivery setup-required
* DB failure → no fake success

---

## 10. Inquiry Flow

Inquiry applies to:

* property
* project
* profile
* requirement/proposal where allowed
* ad/project promotion

Inquiry fields may include:

* message
* name if profile incomplete
* phone/email confirmation
* preferred contact method
* preferred date/time
* budget/interest note
* consent checkbox
* related entity ID
* source page/UTM where safe

Inquiry rules:

1. Guest must login/register first.
2. User must consent to contact sharing where required.
3. Message must be validated.
4. Duplicate inquiry must be prevented or merged.
5. Inquiry creates lead.
6. Inquiry creates lead event.
7. Inquiry triggers notification.
8. Inquiry success shown only after DB success.
9. Hidden contact is not automatically revealed unless action is contact reveal.
10. No fake inquiry.

---

## 11. Contact Reveal Flow

Contact reveal is high privacy risk.

Contact reveal flow:

1. Guest clicks contact/call/WhatsApp → auth popup.
2. Logged-in user clicks reveal/contact.
3. Server checks account status.
4. Server checks target entity status.
5. Server checks role and permission.
6. Server checks contact visibility rule.
7. Server checks rate limit.
8. Server checks duplicate reveal.
9. Server logs consent/reveal.
10. Server creates/reuses lead.
11. Server returns allowed contact fields only.
12. UI displays contact.
13. Notification created for receiver where configured.

Contact reveal must not:

* expose contact in public HTML
* expose contact in public API before authorization
* expose contact in metadata/schema/share text
* reveal to guest
* bypass rate limits
* skip lead/consent log
* fake success if DB fails

Hidden contact leak is critical.

---

## 12. Contact Reveal Status Values

| Status                  | Meaning                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `not_revealed`          | contact not yet revealed              |
| `revealed`              | contact revealed to this user         |
| `request_sent`          | contact request sent but not revealed |
| `blocked`               | reveal blocked                        |
| `rate_limited`          | reveal blocked due to rate limit      |
| `subscription_required` | plan required                         |
| `verification_required` | verification required                 |
| `auth_required`         | login/register required               |
| `unavailable`           | target/contact unavailable            |

---

## 13. Duplicate Lead Prevention

Duplicate prevention must avoid spam and repeated lead inflation.

Duplicate signals:

* same sender
* same receiver
* same entity
* same source
* same day/window
* same mobile/email
* same message similarity
* repeated contact reveal
* repeated proposal
* repeated site visit request

Duplicate behavior:

* reuse existing open lead where appropriate
* add new lead event instead of new lead
* show “Already contacted” or “Inquiry already sent”
* do not increase lead count falsely
* allow genuine repeat after time window if product rules allow
* log duplicate event
* track abuse if excessive

Duplicate prevention must be server-side.

---

## 14. Lead Event Timeline

Every important lead action should create lead event.

Lead event types:

* `message_sent`
* `proposal_sent`

* no fake timeline entries.

---

* assigned agent sees assigned leads only
* unassigned agent cannot access lead
* assignment changes audited
