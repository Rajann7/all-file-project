# My Gujarat Property — Performance, Scalability, Caching And Load Readiness Checklist

This file defines the performance, scalability, caching, database, media, frontend, provider, monitoring and production load-readiness rules for **My Gujarat Property**.

Claude must update this file whenever performance-sensitive code, database queries, indexes, caching, images, media uploads, provider calls, dashboards, search, deployment settings, background jobs or production readiness changes.

Performance is required, but performance must never weaken security, RLS, privacy, payments, provider safety or manual verification.

No fake performance PASS is allowed.

---

## 1. Purpose

This file exists to make sure My Gujarat Property can handle real marketplace traffic safely and smoothly.

| Time to Interactive | Fast enough for mobile dashboard/search | Avoid huge client bundle                       |

### 6.2 Backend Targets

| Area                    | Target                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Public homepage         | Fast cached response where possible                           |
| Search initial response | Paginated, indexed, no unbounded read                         |
| Detail page             | Optimized queries, media lazy-loaded                          |
| Dashboard initial load  | Fast summary with lazy modules                                |
| Admin table load        | Paginated, indexed, filterable                                |
| Contact reveal          | Secure and fast, rate-limited                                 |
| Payment order creation  | Fast but secure, server-verified                              |
| Provider webhook        | Fast acknowledgment, idempotent                               |
| Upload request          | Direct/signed upload where safe; no blocking heavy processing |
| Notification creation   | DB-backed, queue/provider retry where needed                  |
| Cron jobs               | Background, idempotent, not user-request blocking             |

### 6.3 Scalability Target

The architecture must be designed toward:

* **1 lakh live users**
* high public search traffic
* many city/locality SEO pages
* many property/project images
* many dashboard users
* admin moderation queues
* notification events
* payment events
* media uploads
* provider retry jobs
* search/filter operations

This does not mean every feature must be load-tested at full scale immediately, but every implementation must avoid patterns that obviously cannot scale.

## 8. Database Performance Rules

Database performance is critical because real estate search, dashboards, leads, admin queues and SEO pages can grow large.

### 8.1 Database Query Rules

Every database query should:

* fetch only required columns
* use pagination/limit
* use indexed filters
* avoid N+1 patterns
* avoid loading full related records unnecessarily
* avoid unbounded admin exports in normal UI
* avoid joining private tables for public pages unless safe and indexed
* avoid fetching hidden contact fields for public pages
* avoid fetching private documents for non-authorized users
* respect RLS and public-safe views
* separate count queries from list queries if expensive
* use cached public aggregates where safe
* use background jobs for heavy aggregation
* use materialized/cached summaries only if privacy-safe
* use explain/analyze for slow queries where possible

### 8.2 Unbounded Read Ban

Unbounded reads are not allowed.

Bad examples:

```ts id="bad-unbounded-read"
const { data } = await supabase.from("properties").select("*")
```

Required pattern:

```ts id="good-paginated-read"
const { data } = await supabase
  .from("public_properties")
  .select("id,title,slug,city,locality,price,cover_image_url")
  .eq("status", "published")
  .range(offset, offset + pageSize - 1)
```

Rules:

* every list must have limit/range
* every admin table must have pagination
* every dashboard list must lazy load or paginate
* infinite scroll must still use page/cursor/range
* exports must use background job or permission-gated streaming/batches

### 8.3 N+1 Query Ban

Avoid:

* fetching list, then fetching each owner separately
* fetching projects, then fetching units one by one
* fetching leads, then fetching notes one by one
* fetching properties, then fetching images one by one in loop
* fetching notifications, then fetching targets one by one

Use:

* joined views
* batched queries
* server-side functions
* precomputed summaries
* cached safe aggregates
* careful select relationships where supported and safe

### 8.4 Query Field Selection

Public cards should not select:

* full description if card uses excerpt
* hidden phone
* private email
* private address
* internal notes
* verification docs
* payment status
* raw user metadata
* raw provider status

Admin tables should not select heavy detail fields until row detail opens.

Dashboard cards should load summary first, then lazy-load heavy modules.

---

## 9. Database Index Checklist

Indexes should be created for frequent filters, joins and ordering.

Actual index names will be finalized in migrations.

### 9.2 Location/Search Index Areas

Search filters may use:

* country
* state
* district

* city/village
* area
* locality
* society
* building
* pin code
* purpose
* property/project type

Indexes must match actual query patterns.

### 9.3 Text Search Index Areas

If text search is implemented:

* property title
* project name
* locality/city
* society/building
* builder/broker name
* Gujarati/Hindi/English/transliteration fields

Use safe full-text/trigram/search indexes as needed.

Do not implement search by scanning all rows in application memory.

## 10. RLS Performance Rules

RLS must be secure and reasonably efficient.

Rules:

1. RLS policies must not use extremely expensive subqueries without indexes.
2. RLS helper functions should be stable/security-safe where appropriate.
3. Role/permission lookup tables need indexes.
4. Staff permission checks need indexes.
5. Avoid per-row heavy permission checks on huge public search queries.
6. Public search should use public-safe views when possible.
7. Public-safe views should be optimized and indexed through base tables.
8. Never disable RLS for performance.
9. If RLS is slow, optimize indexes/policies.
10. Test both security and performance after RLS changes.

## 39. Current Open Performance Risks

## PERFORMANCE-RISK-20260629-001 — No Implementation Performance Baseline Yet

### Status

`NOT_STARTED`

### Severity

`PERF-S2_MEDIUM`

### Risk

No code implementation has started, so there is no performance baseline.

### Required Action

* Establish baseline in Phase 01.
* Run build/lint/typecheck.
* Track initial bundle/performance after UI routes exist.

### Launch Impact

Production launch blocked until performance verification is done.

---

## PERFORMANCE-RISK-20260629-002 — Database Indexes Not Created Yet

### Status

`NOT_STARTED`

### Severity

`PERF-S1_HIGH` if search/dashboard/admin launched without indexes

### Risk

Search, dashboards, admin queues, notifications and billing can become slow without indexes.

### Required Action

* Add indexes in SQL migrations.
* Review query patterns.
* Test slow queries.
* Update this checklist.

### Launch Impact

Search/dashboard/admin launch blocked if critical indexes missing.

---

## PERFORMANCE-RISK-20260629-003 — Media Optimization Provider Not Configured Yet

### Status

`SETUP_REQUIRED`

### Severity

`PERF-S1_HIGH` if media-heavy public pages launched unoptimized

### Risk

Property/project images and videos can slow down public pages.

### Required Action

* Configure R2/CDN/media processing or safe setup-required state.
* Use optimized images and lazy loading.
* Avoid original images in cards.

### Launch Impact

Media-heavy launch blocked or degraded until optimized.

---

## PERFORMANCE-RISK-20260629-004 — Provider Timeout/Fallback Not Implemented Yet

### Status

`SETUP_REQUIRED`

### Severity

`PERF-S2_MEDIUM`

### Risk

Slow OTP/payment/maps/storage/email/SMS/WhatsApp providers can block user flows or create poor UX.

### Required Action

* Implement provider timeouts.
* Implement setup-required/fallback states.
* Queue non-critical sends.
* Update `API_PROVIDER_STATUS.md`.

### Launch Impact

Provider-backed features cannot be `PASS` until fallback/timeout behavior is verified.

---

## PERFORMANCE-RISK-20260629-005 — Load Testing Not Started

### Status

`NOT_STARTED`

### Severity

`PERF-S2_MEDIUM`

### Risk

1 lakh live user target requires load-readiness checks before launch.

### Required Action

* Run staging load tests for critical flows.
* Track bottlenecks.
* Fix S0/S1/S2 issues before production.

### Launch Impact

Production launch cannot claim scale readiness without load/stress verification or documented partial/blocker.

## 43. Resume Guide For Future Claude

Before touching performance-sensitive code, Claude must read:

1. `CLAUDE.md`
2. `brain.md`
3. `FEATURE_REGISTRY.md`
4. `CHANGELOG.md`
5. `BUGS_AND_FIXES.md`
6. `MANUAL_VERIFICATION.md`
7. `API_PROVIDER_STATUS.md`
8. `DEPLOYMENT_ROLLBACK.md`
9. `SECURITY_RLS_CHECKLIST.md`
10. `PERFORMANCE_CHECKLIST.md`
11. relevant detailed docs
12. current SQL/migration files
13. current routes/components/server actions
14. current database query patterns

Claude must inspect existing implementation before optimizing.

Claude must not optimize blindly.

Claude must not sacrifice correctness, security, privacy, payment safety or user trust for speed.

---

## 44. Final Rule

Performance is mandatory.

Scalability is mandatory.

Pagination is mandatory for growing lists.

Indexes are mandatory for frequent filters.

Image optimization is mandatory for media-heavy pages.

Provider fallbacks are mandatory.

Monitoring is mandatory before serious production launch.

But security, RLS, hidden contact privacy, private documents, payment verification and accurate real data are more important than raw speed.

A feature is not performance-ready until it is fast enough, safe enough, documented and verified.

Never fake speed.

Never fake analytics.

Never fake PASS.
